<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">During</span> the passage of this story through
<span class="smcap">The Christian Union</span>, it has been repeatedly
taken for granted by the public press
that certain of the characters are designed as portraits
of really existing individuals.</p>

<p>They are not. The supposition has its rise in an
imperfect consideration of the principles of dramatic
composition. The novel-writer does not profess to
paint <em>portraits</em> of any individual men and women in his
personal acquaintance. Certain characters are required
for the purposes of his story. He conceives and creates
them, and they become to him real living beings,
acting and speaking in ways of their own. But
on the other hand, he is guided in this creation by
his knowledge and experience of men and women, and
studies individual instances and incidents only to assure
himself of the possibility and probability of the
character he creates. If he succeeds in making the
character real and natural, people often are led to
identify it with some individual of their acquaintance.
A slight incident, an anecdote, a paragraph in a paper,
often furnishes the foundation of such a character;
and the work of drawing it is like the process by
which Professor Agassiz from one bone reconstructs
the whole form of an unknown fish. But to apply to   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
any single living person such delineation is a mistake,
and might be a great wrong both to the author and to
the person designated.</p>

<p>For instance, it being the author's purpose to
show the embarrassment of the young champion of
progressive principles, in meeting the excesses of
modern reformers, it came in her way to paint the
picture of the modern emancipated young woman of
advanced ideas and free behavior. And this character
has been mistaken for the portrait of an <em>individual</em>,
drawn from actual observation. On the contrary,
it was not the author's intention to draw
an individual, but simply to show the type of a
class. Facts as to conduct and behavior similar to
those she has described are unhappily too familiar
to residents of New York. But in this as in other
cases the author has simply used isolated facts in
the construction of a dramatic character suited to
the design of the story. If the readers of to-day
will turn back to Miss Edgeworth's <em>Belinda</em>, they
will find that this style of manners, these assumptions
and mode of asserting them, are no new things. In
the character of Harriet Freke, Miss Edgeworth
vividly portrays the manners and sentiments of the
modern emancipated women of our times, who think
themselves</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <span class="verse">"Ne'er so sure our passion to create,<br /></span>
      <span class="verse">As when they touch the brink of all we hate."<br /></span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Certainly the author knows no original fully answering
to the character of Mrs. Cerulean, though
she has heard such an one described; and, doubtless,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>

there are traits in her equally attributable to all fair
enthusiasts who mistake the influence of their own
personal charms and fascinations over the other sex,
for real superiority of intellect.</p>

<p>There are happily several young women whose vigorous
self-sustaining career, in opening paths of usefulness
alike for themselves and others, are like that
of Ida Van Arsdel; and the true experiences of a
lovely New York girl first suggested the character
of Eva; yet both of them are, in execution, strictly
imaginary paintings, adapted to the story. In short,
some real character, or, in many cases, some two or
three, furnish the germs, but the germs only, out of
which new characters are developed.</p>

<p>In close: The author wishes to dedicate this Story
to the many dear, bright young girls whom she is so
happy as to number among her choicest friends. No
matter what the critics say of it, if <em>they</em> like it; and
she hopes from them, at least, a favorable judgment.</p>

adults in the <cite>Atlantic</cite>, in the <cite>Overland</cite>, in the <cite>Galaxy</cite>, in

pilgrims in <cite>Our Young Folks</cite>, the <cite>Little Corporal</cite>, "<cite>Oliver
Optic</cite>," the <cite>Youth's Companion</cite>, and very soon we anticipate
newspapers with serial stories for the nursery. We shall have
those charmingly illustrated magazines, the <cite>Cradle</cite>, the <cite>Rocking
Chair</cite>, the <cite>First Rattle</cite>, and the <cite>First Tooth</cite>, with successive
chapters of "Goosy Goosy Gander," and "Hickory
Dickory Dock," and "Old Mother Hubbard," extending
through twelve, or twenty-four, or forty-eight numbers.</p>

<p>I have often questioned what Solomon would have said if
he had lived in our day. The poor man, it appears, was
somewhat <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i> with the abundance of literature in his times,
and remarked that much study was weariness to the flesh.
Then, printing was not invented, and "books" were all
copied by hand, in those very square Hebrew letters where
each letter is about as careful a bit of work as a grave-stone.
And yet, even with all these restrictions and circumscriptions,
Solomon rather testily remarked, "Of making many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
books there is no end!" What would he have said had he
looked over a modern publisher's catalogue?</p>

<p>It is understood now that no paper is complete without its
serial story, and the spinning of these stories keeps thousands
of wheels and spindles in motion. It is now understood
that whoever wishes to gain the public ear, and to
propound a new theory, must do it in a serial story. Hath
any one in our day, as in St. Paul's, a psalm, a doctrine, a
tongue, a revelation, an interpretation&mdash;forthwith he wraps
it up in a serial story, and presents it to the public. We
have prison discipline, free-trade, labor and capital, woman's
rights, the temperance question, in serial stories. We have
Romanism and Protestantism, High Church, and Low Church
and no Church, contending with each other in serial stories,
where each side converts the other, according to the faith of
the narrator.</p>

<p>We see that this thing is to go on. Soon it will be necessary
that every leading clergyman should embody in his
theology a serial story, to be delivered from the pulpit Sunday
after Sunday. We look forward to announcements in
our city papers such as these: The Rev. Dr. Ignatius, of the
Church of St. Mary the Virgin, will begin a serial romance,
to be entitled "St. Sebastian and the Arrows," in which he
will embody the duties, the trials, and the temptations of
the young Christians of our day. The Rev. Dr. Boanerges,
of Plymouth Rock Church, will begin a serial story, entitled
"Calvin's Daughter," in which he will discuss the distinctive
features of Protestant theology. The Rev. Dr. Cool Shadow
will go on with his interesting romance of "Christianity a
Dissolving View,"&mdash;designed to show how everything is, in
many respects, like everything else, and all things lead
somewhere, and everything will finally end somehow, and
that therefore it is important that everybody should cultivate
general sweetness, and have the very best time possible
in this world.</p>

<p>By the time all these romances get to going, the system of
teaching by parables, and opening one's mouth in dark
sayings, will be fully elaborated. <cite>Pilgrim's Progress</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
will be no where. The way to the celestial city will be as
plain in everybody's mind as the way up Broadway&mdash;and so
much more interesting! Finally all science and all art will
be explained, conducted, and directed by serial stories, till
the present life and the life to come shall form only one
grand romance. This will be about the time of the Millennium.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have been furnishing a story for the <cite>Christian
Union</cite>, and I chose the subject which is in everybody's
mind and mouth, discussed on every platform, ringing from
everybody's tongue, and coming home to every man's business
and bosom, to wit:</p>

<p class="oldeng">My Wife and I.</p>

<p>I trust that Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton, and all the
prophetesses of our day, will remark the humility and propriety
of my title. It is not I and My Wife&mdash;oh no! It is
My Wife and I. What am I, and what is my father's house,
that I should go before my wife in anything?</p>

<p>"But why specially for the <cite>Christian Union?</cite>" says Mr.
Chadband. Let us in a spirit of Love inquire.</p>

<p>Is it not evident why, O beloved? Is not that firm in human
nature which stands under the title of <span class="smcap">My Wife and I</span>,
the oldest and most venerable form of Christian union on
record? Where, I ask, will you find a better one?&mdash;a wiser,
a stronger, a sweeter, a more universally popular and agreeable
one?</p>

<p>To be sure, there have been times and seasons when this
ancient and respectable firm has been attacked as a piece of
old fogyism, and various substitutes for it proposed. It
has been said that "<span class="smcap">My Wife and I</span>" denoted a selfish,
close corporation inconsistent with a general, all-sided diffusive,
universal benevolence; that <span class="smcap">My Wife and I</span>, in a
millennial community, had no particular rights in each other
more than any of the thousands of the brethren and sisters
of the human race. They have said, too, that <span class="smcap">My Wife
and I</span>, instead of an indissoluble unity, were only temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3b" id="Page_3b">[3b]</a></span>
partners, engaged on time, with the liberty of giving three
months' notice, and starting off to a new firm.</p>

<p>It is not thus that we understand the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Wife and I</span>, as we understand it, is the sign and symbol
of more than any earthly partnership or union&mdash;of
something sacred as religion, indissoluble as the soul, endless
as eternity&mdash;the symbol chosen by Almighty Love to
represent his redeeming, eternal union with the soul of man.</p>

<p>A fountain of eternal youth gushes near the hearth of
every household. Each man and woman that have loved
truly, have had their romance in life&mdash;their poetry in existence.</p>

<p>So I, in giving my history, disclaim all other sources of
interest. Look not for trap-doors, or haunted houses, or
deadly conspiracies, or murders, or concealed crimes, in this
history, for you will not find one. You shall have simply
and only the old story&mdash;old as the first chapter of Genesis&mdash;of
Adam stupid, desolate, and lonely without Eve, and how
he sought and how he found her.</p>

<p>This much, on mature consideration I hold to be about
the sum and substance of all the romances that have ever
been written, and so long as there are new Adams and new
Eves in each coming generation, it will not want for sympathetic
listeners.</p>

<p>So I, Harry Henderson&mdash;a plain Yankee boy from the
mountains of New Hampshire, and at present citizen of
New York&mdash;commence my story.</p>

<p>My experiences have three stages.</p>

<p>First, My child-wife, or the experiences of childhood.</p>

<p>Second, My shadow-wife, or the dreamland of the future.</p>

<p>Third, my real wife, where I saw her, how I sought and
found her.</p>

<p>In pursuing a story simply and mainly of love and marriage,
I am reminded of the saying of a respectable serving
man of European experiences, who speaking of his position
in a noble family said it was not so much the wages that
made it an object as "<em>the things it enabled a gentleman to</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<em>pick up</em>." So in our modern days as we have been observing,
it is not so much the story, as the things it gives the
author a chance to say. The history of a young American
man's progress toward matrimony, of course brings him
among the most stirring and exciting topics of the day,
where all that relates to the joint interests of man and
woman has been thrown into the arena as an open question,
and in relating our own experiences, we shall take occasion
to keep up with the spirit of this discussing age in all these
matters.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Bible says it is not good for man to be alone.
This is a truth that has been borne in on my
mind, with peculiar force, from the earliest of my
recollection. In fact when I was only seven years old I
had selected my wife, and asked the paternal consent.</p>

<p>You see, I was an unusually lonesome little fellow, because
I belonged to the number of those unlucky waifs who come
into this mortal life under circumstances when nobody wants
or expects them. My father was a poor country minister in
the mountains of New Hampshire with a salary of six hundred
dollars, with nine children. I was the tenth. I was
not expected; my immediate predecessor was five years of
age, and the gossips of the neighborhood had already presented
congratulations to my mother on having "done up
her work in the forenoon," and being ready to sit down to
afternoon leisure.</p>

<p>Her well-worn baby clothes were all given away, the cradle
was peaceably consigned to the garret, and my mother was
now regarded as without excuse if she did not preside at the
weekly prayer-meeting, the monthly Maternal Association,
and the Missionary meeting, and perform besides regular
pastoral visitations among the good wives of her parish.</p>

<p>No one, of course, ever thought of voting her any little
extra salary on account of these public duties which absorbed
so much time and attention from her perplexing
domestic cares&mdash;rendered still more severe and onerous by
my father's limited salary. My father's six hundred dollars,
however, was considered by the farmers of the vicinity as
being a princely income, which accounted satisfactorily for
everything, and had he not been considered by them as
"about the smartest man in the State," they could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
gone up to such a figure. My mother was one of those gentle,
soft-spoken, quiet little women who, like oil, permeate
every crack and joint of life with smoothness.</p>

<p>With a noiseless step, an almost shadowy movement, her
hand and eye were every where. Her house was a miracle
of neatness and order&mdash;her children of all ages and sizes
under her perfect control, and the accumulations of labor of
all descriptions which beset a great family where there are
no servants, all melted away under her hands as if by enchantment.</p>

<p>She had a divine magic too, that mother of mine; if it be
magic to commune daily with the supernatural. She had
a little room all her own, where on a stand always lay
open the great family Bible, and when work pressed hard
and children were untoward, when sickness threatened,
when the skeins of life were all crossways and tangled, she
went quietly to that room, and kneeling over that Bible,
took hold of a warm, healing, invisible hand, that made the
crooked straight, and the rough places plain.</p>

<p>"Poor Mrs. Henderson&mdash;another boy!" said the gossips on
the day that I was born. "What a shame! poor woman.
Well, I wish her joy!"</p>

<p>But she took me to a warm bosom and bade God bless
me! All that God sent to her was treasure. "Who
knows," she said cheerily to my father, "this may be our
brightest."</p>

<p>"God bless him," said my father, kissing me and my
mother, and then he returned to an important treatise which
was to reconcile the decrees of God with the free agency of
man, and which the event of my entrance into this world
had interrupted for some hours. The sermon was a perfect
success I am told, and nobody that heard it ever had a moment's
further trouble on that subject.</p>

<p>As to me, my outfit for this world was of the scantest-a
few yellow flannel petticoats and a few slips run up from
some of my older sisters cast off white gowns, were deemed
sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The first child in a family is its poem&mdash;it is a sort of
nativity play, and we bend before the young stranger, with
gifts, "gold, frankincense and myrrh." But the tenth child
in a poor family is <i>prose</i>, and gets simply what is due to
comfort. There are no superfluities, no fripperies, no idealities
about the tenth cradle.</p>

<p>As I grew up I found myself rather a solitary little fellow
in a great house, full of the bustle and noise and conflicting
claims of older brothers and sisters, who had got the floor in
the stage of life before me, and who were too busy with
their own wants, schemes and plans, to regard me.</p>

<p>I was all very well so long as I kept within the limits of
babyhood. They said I was the handsomest baby ever pertaining
to the family establishment, and as long as that
quality and condition lasted I was made a pet of. My sisters
curled my golden locks and made me wonderful little frocks,
and took me about to show me. But when I grew bigger,
and the golden locks were sheared off and replaced by
straight light hair, and I was inducted into jacket and
pantaloons, cut down by Miss Abia Ferkin from my next
brother's last year's suit, outgrown&mdash;then I was turned upon
the world to shift for myself. Babyhood was over, and manhood
not begun&mdash;I was to run the gauntlet of boyhood.</p>

<p>My brothers and sisters were affectionate enough in their
way, but had not the least sentiment, and as I said before
they had each one their own concerns to look after. My
eldest brother was in college, my next brother was fitting
for college in a neighboring academy, and used to walk ten
miles daily to his lessons and take his dinner with him. One
of my older sisters was married, the two next were handsome
lively girls, with a retinue of beaux, who of course took
up a deal of their time and thoughts. The sister next before
me was four years above me on the lists of life, and of course
looked down on me as a little boy unworthy of her society.
When her two or three chattering girl friends came to see
her and they had their dolls and their baby houses to manage,
I was always in the way. They laughed at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
awkwardness, criticised my nose, my hair, and my ears to my
face, with that feminine freedom by which the gentler sex
joy to put down the stronger one when they have it at advantage.
I used often to retire from their society swelling
with impotent wrath, at their free comments. "I won't play
with you," I would exclaim. "Nobody wants you," would
be the rejoinder. "We've been wanting to be rid of you this
good while."</p>

<p>But as I was a stout little fellow, my elders thought it advisable
to devolve on me any such tasks and errands as
interfered with their comfort. I was sent to the store when
the wind howled and the frost bit, and my brothers and sisters
preferred a warm corner. "He's only a boy, he can go,
or he can do or he can wait," was always the award of my
sisters.</p>

<p>My individual pursuits, and my own little stock of interests,
were of course of no account. I was required to be in
a perfectly free, disengaged state of mind, and ready to drop
every thing at a moment's warning from any of my half
dozen seniors. "Here Hal, run down cellar and get me a
dozen apples," my brother would say, just as I had half built
a block house. "Harry, run up stairs and get the book I left
on the bed&mdash;Harry, run out to the barn and get the rake I
left there&mdash;Here, Harry, carry this up garret&mdash;Harry, run out
to the tool shop and get that"&mdash;were sounds constantly occurring&mdash;breaking
up my private cherished little enterprises
of building cob-houses, making mill dams and bridges, or
loading carriages, or driving horses. Where is the mature
Christian who could bear with patience the interruptions and
crosses in his daily schemes, that beset a boy?</p>

<p>Then there were for me dire mortifications and bitter disappointments.
If any company came and the family board
was filled and the cake and preserves brought out, and gay
conversation made my heart bound with special longings to
be in at the fun, I heard them say, "No need to set a plate
for Harry&mdash;he can just as well wait till after." I can recollect
many a serious deprivation of mature life, that did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
bring such bitterness of soul as that sentence of exclusion.
Then when my sister's admirer, Sam Richards, was expected,
and the best parlor fire lighted, and the hearth swept, how
I longed to sit up and hear his funny stories, how I hid in
dark corners, and lay off in shadowy places, hoping to escape
notice and so avoid the activity of the domestic police. But
no, "Mamma, mustn't Harry go to bed?" was the busy outcry
of my sisters, desirous to have the deck cleared for
action, and superfluous members finally disposed of.</p>

<p>Take it for all in all&mdash;I felt myself, though not wanting in
the supply of any physical necessity, to be somehow, as I
said, a very lonesome little fellow in the world. In all that
busy, lively, gay, bustling household I had no mate.</p>

<p>"I think we must send Harry to school," said my mother,
gently, to my father, when I had vented this complaint in
her maternal bosom. "Poor little fellow, he is an odd one!&mdash;there
isn't exactly any one in the house for him to mate
with!"</p>

<p>So to school I was sent, with a clean checked apron,
drawn up tight in my neck, and a dinner basket, and a
brown towel on which I was to be instructed in the wholesome
practice of sewing. I went, trembling and blushing,
with many an apprehension of the big boys who had promised
to thrash me when I came; but the very first day I was
made blessed in the vision of my little child-wife, Susie
Morril.</p>

<p>Such a pretty, neat little figure as she was! I saw her first
standing in the school-room door. Her cheeks and neck
were like wax; her eyes clear blue; and when she smiled,
two little dimples flitted in and out on her cheeks, like those
in a sunny brook. She was dressed in a pink gingham
frock, with a clean white apron fitted trimly about her little
round neck. She was her mother's only child, and always
daintily dressed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Susie dear," said my mother, who had me by the
hand, "I've brought a little boy here to school, and will be
a mate for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>How affably and graciously she received me&mdash;the little
Eve&mdash;all smiles and obligingness and encouragement for the
lumpish, awkward Adam. How she made me sit down on a
seat by her, and put her little white arm cosily over my
neck, as she laid the spelling-book on her knee, saying&mdash;"<em>I</em>
read in Baker. Where do you read?"</p>

<p>Friend, it was Webster's Spelling-book that was their
text-book, and many of you will remember where "Baker"
is in that literary career. The column of words thus headed
was a mile-stone on the path of infant progress. But my
mother had been a diligent instructress at home, and I an
apt scholar, and my breast swelled as I told little Susie
that I had gone beyond Baker. I saw "respect mingling
with surprise" in her great violet eyes; my soul was enlarged&mdash;my
little frame dilated, as turning over to the picture of
the "old man who found a rude boy on one of his trees
stealing apples," I answered her that I had read there!</p>

<p>"Why-<em>ee!</em>" said the little maiden; "only think, girls&mdash;he
reads in readings!"</p>

<p>I was set up and glorified in my own esteem; two or three
girls looked at me with evident consideration.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to sit on our side?" said Susie, engagingly.
"I'll ask Miss Bessie to let you, 'cause she said the big
boys always plague the little ones." And so, as she was a
smooth-tongued little favorite, she not only introduced me
to the teacher, but got me comfortably niched, beside her
dainty self on the hard, backless seat, where I sat swinging
my heels, and looking for all the world like a rough little
short-tailed robin, just pushed out of the nest, and surveying
the world with round, anxious eyes. The big boys
quizzed me, made hideous faces at me from behind their
spelling-books, and great hulking Tom Halliday threw a spit
ball that lodged on the wall just over my head, by way of
showing his contempt for me; but I looked at Susie, and
took courage. I thought I never saw anything so pretty as
she was. I was never tired with following the mazes of her
golden curls. I thought how dainty and nice and white her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
pink dress and white apron were; and she wore a pair of
wonderful little red shoes; her tiny hands were so skillful
and so busy! She turned the hem of my brown towel, and
basted it for me so nicely, and then she took out some
delicate ruffling that was her school work, and I admired
her bright, fine needle and fine thread, and the waxen little
finger crowned with a little brass thimble, as she sewed
away with an industrious steadiness. To me the brass was
gold, and her hands were pearl, and she was a little fairy
princess!&mdash;yet every few moments she turned her great blue
eyes on me, and smiled and nodded her little head knowingly,
as much as to bid me be of good cheer, and I felt a thrill
go right to my heart, that beat delightedly under the checked
apron.</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am," said Susan, glibly, "mayn't Henry go
out to play with the girls? The big boys are so rough."</p>

<p>And Miss Bessie smiled, and said I might; and I was a
blessed little boy from that moment. In the first recess Susie
instructed me in playing "Tag," and "Oats, peas, beans, and
barley, O," and in "Threading the needle," and "Opening
the gates as high as high as the sky, to let King George and
his court pass by"&mdash;in all which she was a proficient, and
where I needed a great deal of teaching and encouraging.</p>

<p>But when it came to more athletic feats, I could distinguish
myself. I dared jump off from a higher fence than she
could, and covered myself with glory by climbing to the top
of a five-railed gate, and jumping boldly down; and moreover,
when a cow appeared on the green before the school-house
door, I marched up to her with a stick and ordered her
off, with a manly stride and a determined voice, and chased
her with the utmost vigor quite out of sight. These proceedings
seemed to inspire Susie with a certain respect and
confidence. I could read in "readings," jump off from high
fences, and wasn't afraid of cows! These were manly accomplishments!</p>

<p>The school-house was a long distance from my father's,
and I used to bring my dinner. Susie brought hers also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and many a delightful picnic have we had together. We
made ourselves a house under a great button-ball tree, at
whose foot the grass was short and green. Our house was
neither more nor less than a square, marked out on the
green turf by stones taken from the wall. I glorified myself
in my own eyes and in Susie's, by being able to lift stones
twice as heavy as she could, and a big flat one, which nearly
broke my back, was deposited in the centre of the square, as
our table. We used a clean pocket-handkerchief for a table-cloth;
and Susie was wont to set out our meals with great
order, making plates and dishes out of the button-ball
leaves. Under her direction also, I fitted up our house with
a pantry, and a small room where we used to play wash
dishes, and set away what was left of our meals. The pantry
was a stone cupboard, where we kept chestnuts and
apples, and what remained of our cookies and gingerbread.
Susie was fond of ornamentation, and stuck bouquets of
golden rod and aster around in our best room, and there we
received company, and had select society come to see us.
Susie brought her doll to dwell in this establishment, and I
made her a bedroom and a little bed of milkweed-silk to lie
on. We put her to bed and tucked her up when we went
into school&mdash;not without apprehension that those savages,
the big boys, might visit our Eden with devastation. But
the girls' recess came first, and we could venture to leave her
there taking a nap till our play-time came; and when the
girls went in Susie rolled her nursling in a napkin and took
her safely into school, and laid her away in a corner of her
desk, while the dreadful big boys were having their yelling
war-whoop and carnival outside.</p>

<p>"How nice it is to have Harry gone all day to school," I
heard one of my sisters saying to the other. "He used to
be so in the way, meddling and getting into everything"&mdash;"And
listening to everything one says," said the other,
"Children have such horridly quick ears. Harry always
listens to what we talk about."</p>

<p>"I think he is happier now, poor little fellow," said my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mother. "He has somebody now to play with." This was
the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoons, I used to beg of my mother to
let me go and see Susie; and my sisters, nothing loth, used
to brush my hair and put on me a stiff, clean, checked apron,
and send me trotting off, the happiest of young lovers.</p>

<p>How bright and fair life seemed to me those Saturday
afternoons, when the sun, through the picket-fences, made
golden-green lines on the turf&mdash;and the trees waved and
whispered, and I gathered handfuls of golden-rod and asters
to ornament our house, under the button-wood tree!</p>

<p>Then we used to play in the barn together. We hunted
for hens' eggs, and I dived under the barn to dark places
where she dared not go; and climbed up to high places over
the hay-mow, where she trembled to behold me&mdash;bringing
stores of eggs, which she received in her clean white apron.</p>

<p>This daintiness of outfit excited my constant admiration.
I wore stiff, heavy jackets and checked aprons, and was constantly,
so my sisters said, wearing holes through my knees
and elbows for them to patch; but little Susie always appeared
to me fresh and fine and untumbled; she never
dirtied her hands or soiled her dress. Like a true little
woman, she seemed to have nerves through all her clothes
that kept them in order. This nicety of person inspired me
with a secret, wondering reverence. How could she always
be so clean, so trim, and every way so pretty, I wondered?
Her golden curls always seemed fresh from the brush, and
even when she climbed and ran, and went with me into the
barn-yard, or through the swamp and into all sorts of compromising
places, she somehow picked her way out bright
and unsoiled.</p>

<p>But though I admired her ceaselessly for this, she was no
less in admiration of my daring strength and prowess. I felt
myself a perfect Paladin in her defense. I remember that
the chip-yard which we used to cross, on our way to the
barn, was tyrannized over by a most loud-mouthed and
arrogant old turkey-cock, that used to strut and swell and
gobble and chitter greatly to her terror. She told me of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
different times when she had tried to cross the yard alone,
how he had jumped upon her and flapped his wings, and
thrown her down, to her great distress and horror. The
first time he tried the game on me, I marched up to him, and
by a dexterous pass, seized his red neck in my hand, and confining
his wings down with my arm, walked him ingloriously
out of the yard.</p>

<p>How triumphant Susie was, and how I swelled and exulted
to her, telling her what I would do to protect her under
every supposable variety of circumstances! Susie had confessed
to me of being dreadfully afraid of "bears," and I
took this occasion to tell her what I would do if a bear should
actually attack her. I assured her that I would get father's
gun and shoot him without mercy&mdash;and she listened and believed.
I also dilated on what I would do if robbers should
get into the house; I would, I informed her, immediately get
up and pour shovelfuls of hot coal down their backs&mdash;and
wouldn't they have to run? What comfort and security this
view of matters gave us both! What bears and robbers
were, we had no very precise idea, but it was a comfort to
think how strong and adequate to meet them in any event I
was.</p>

<p>Sometimes, of a Saturday afternoon, Susie was permitted
to come and play with me. I always went after her, and
solicited the favor humbly at the hands of her mother, who,
after many washings and dressings and cautions as to her
clothes, delivered her up to me, with the condition that she
was to start for home when the sun was half an hour high.
Susie was very conscientious in watching, but for my part I
never agreed with her. I was always sure that the sun was
an hour high, when she set her little face dutifully homeward.
My sisters used to pet her greatly during these visits.
They delighted to twine her curls over their fingers, and try
the effects of different articles of costume on her fair complexion.
They would ask her, laughing, would she be my
little wife, to which she always answered with a grave
affirmative.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MATRIMONIAL PROPOSITIONS.</p>
<p>"Early marriages?" said my mother, stopping her knitting looking at
me, while a smile flashed over her thin cheeks: "what's the child thinking
of?"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Yes, she was to be my wife; it was all settled between us.
But when? I didn't see why we must wait till we grew up.
She was lonesome when I was gone, and I was lonesome
when she was gone. Why not marry her now, and take her
home to live with me? I asked her and she said she was
willing, but mamma never would spare her. I said I would
get my mamma to ask her, and I knew she couldn't refuse,
because my papa was the minister.</p>

<p>I turned the matter over and over in my mind, and thought
sometime when I could find my mother alone, I would introduce
the subject. So one evening, as I sat on my little stool
at my mother's knees, I thought I would open the subject,
and began:</p>

<p>"Mamma, why do people object to early marriages?"</p>

<p>"Early marriages?" said my mother, stopping her knitting,
looking at me, while a smile flashed over her thin
cheeks: "what's the child thinking of?"</p>

<p>"I mean, why can't Susie and I be married now? I want
her here. I'm lonesome without her. Nobody wants to play
with me in this house, and if she were here we should be together
all the time."</p>

<p>My father woke up from his meditation on his next Sunday's
sermon, and looked at my mother, smiling. A gentle
laugh rippled her bosom.</p>

<p>"Why, dear," she said, "don't you know your father is a
poor man, and has hard work to support his children now?
He couldn't afford to keep another little girl."</p>

<p>I thought the matter over, sorrowfully. Here was the
pecuniary difficulty, that puts off so many desiring lovers,
meeting me on the very threshold of life.</p>

<p>"Mother," I said, after a period of mournful consideration,
"I wouldn't eat but just half as much as I do now, and I'd
try not to wear out my clothes, and make 'em last longer."
My mother had very bright eyes, and there was a mingled
flash of tears and laughter in them, as when the sun winks
through rain drops. She lifted me gently into her lap and
drew my head down on her bosom.</p>

<p>"Some day, when my little son grows to be a man, I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
God will give him a wife he loves dearly. 'Houses and
lands are from the fathers; but a good wife is of the Lord,'
the Bible says."</p>

<p>"That's true, dear," said my father, looking at her tenderly;
"nobody knows that better than I do."</p>

<p>My mother rocked gently back and forward with me in the
evening shadows, and talked with me and soothed me, and
told me stories how one day I should grow to be a good man&mdash;a
minister, like my father, she hoped&mdash;and have a dear little
house of my own.</p>

<p>"And will Susie be in it?"</p>

<p>"Let's hope so," said my mother. "Who knows?"</p>

<p>"But, mother, ain't you sure? I want you to say it will be
certainly."</p>

<p>"My little one, only our dear Father could tell us that,"
said my mother. "But now you must try and learn fast,
and become a good strong man, so that you can take care of
a little wife."</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My</span> mother's talk aroused all the enthusiasm of my
nature. Here was a motive, to be sure. I went
to bed and dreamed of it. I thought over all
possible ways of growing big and strong rapidly&mdash;I had
heard the stories of Samson from the Bible. How did he
grow so strong? He was probably once a little boy like
me. "Did he go for the cows, I wonder," thought I&mdash;"and
let down very big bars when his hands were little, and learn
to ride the old horse bare-back, when his legs were very
short?" All these things I was emulous to do; and I resolved
to lift very heavy pails full of water, and very many
of them, and to climb into the mow, and throw down great
armfulls of hay, and in every possible way to grow big and
strong.</p>

<p>I remember the next day after my talk with my mother
was <em>Saturday</em>, and I had leave to go up and spend it with
Susie.</p>

<p>There was a meadow just back of her mother's house,
which we used to call the mowing lot. It was white with
daisies, yellow with buttercups, with some moderate share
of timothy and herds grass intermixed. But what was specially
interesting to us was, that, down low at the roots of
the grass, and here and there in moist, rich spots, grew wild
strawberries, large and juicy, rising on nice high stalks,
with three or four on a cluster. What joy there was in the
possession of a whole sunny Saturday afternoon to be spent
with Susie in this meadow! To me the amount of happiness
in the survey was greatly in advance of what I now
have in the view of a three weeks' summer excursion.</p>

<p>When, after multiplied cautions and directions, and careful
adjustment of Susie's clothing, on the part of her mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Susie was fairly delivered up to me; when we had turned
our backs on the house and got beyond call, then our
bliss was complete. How carefully and patronizingly I
helped her up the loose, mossy, stone wall, all hedged with
a wilderness of golden-rod, ferns, raspberry bushes, and asters!
Down we went through this tangled thicket, into such
a secure world of joy, where the daisied meadow received
us to her motherly bosom, and we were sure nobody
could see us.</p>

<p>We could sit down and look upward, and see daisies and
grasses nodding and bobbing over our heads, hiding us as
completely as two young grass birds; and it was such fun
to think that nobody could find out where we were! Two
bob-o-links, who had a nest somewhere in that lot, used to
mount guard in an old apple tree, and sit on tall, bending
twigs, and say, "Chack! chack! chack!" and flutter their
black and white wings up and down, and burst out into
most elaborate and complicated babbles of melody. These
were our only associates and witnesses. We thought that
they knew us, and were glad to see us there, and wouldn't
tell anybody where we were for the world. There was an
exquisite pleasure to us in this sense of utter isolation&mdash;of
being hid with each other where nobody could find us.</p>

<p>We had worlds of nice secrets peculiar to ourselves. Nobody
but ourselves knew where the "thick spots" were,
where the ripe, scarlet strawberries grew; the big boys
never suspected them, we said to one another, nor the big
girls; it was our own secret, which we kept between our own
little selves. How we searched, and picked, and chatted, and
oh'd and ah'd to each other, as we found wonderful places,
where the strawberries passed all belief!</p>

<p>But profoundest of all our wonderful secrets were our discoveries
in the region of animal life. We found, in a tuft
of grass overshadowed by wild roses, a grass bird's nest.
In vain did the cunning mother creep yards from the cherished
spot, and then suddenly fly up in the wrong place; we
were not to be deceived. Our busy hands parted the lace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
curtains of fern, and, with whispers of astonishment, we
counted the little speckled, bluegreen eggs. How round and
fine and exquisite, past all gems polished by art, they seemed;
and what a mystery was the little curious smooth-lined
nest in which we found them! We talked to the birds
encouragingly. "Dear little birds," we said, "don't be afraid;
nobody but we shall know it;" and then we said to each
other, "Tom Halliday never shall find this out, nor Jim
Fellows." They would carry off the eggs and tear up the
nest; and our hearts swelled with such a responsibility for
the tender secret, that it was all we could do that week to
avoid telling it to everybody we met. We informed all the
children at school that we knew something that they didn't&mdash;something
that we <em>never</em> should tell!&mdash;something <em>so</em> wonderful!&mdash;something
that it would be wicked to tell of&mdash;for
mother said so; for be it observed that, like good children,
we had taken our respective mothers into confidence, and
received the strictest and most conscientious charges as to
our duty to keep the birds' secret.</p>

<p>In that enchanted meadow of ours grew tall, yellow lilies,
glowing as the sunset, hanging down their bells, six or seven
in number, from high, graceful stalks, like bell towers of
fairy land. They were over our heads sometimes, as they
rose from the grass and daisies, and we looked up into their
golden hearts spotted with black, with a secret, wondering
joy.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't pick them, they look too pretty," said Susie to
me once when I stretched up my hand to gather one of these.
"Let's leave them to be here when we come again! I like to
see them wave."</p>

<p>And so we left the tallest of them; but I was not forbidden
to gather handfuls of the less wonderful specimens that
grew only one or two on a stalk. Our bouquets of flowers
increased with our strawberries.</p>

<p>Through the middle of this meadow chattered a little
brook, gurgling and tinkling over many-colored pebbles,
and here and there collecting itself into a miniature waterfall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
as it pitched over a broken bit of rock. For our height
and size, the waterfalls of this little brook were equal to
those of Trenton, or any of the medium cascades that draw
the fashionable crowd of grown-up people; and what was
the best of it was, it was <em>our</em> brook, and <em>our</em> waterfall. <em>We</em>
found them, and we verily believed nobody else but ourselves
knew of them.</p>

<p>By this waterfall, as I called it, which was certainly a
foot and a half high, we sat and arranged our strawberries
when our baskets were full, and I talked with Susie about
what my mother had told me.</p>

<p>I can see her now, the little crumb of womanhood, as she
sat, gaily laughing at me. "<em>She</em> didn't care a bit," she
said. <em>She</em> had just as lief wait till I grew to be a man.
Why, we could go to school together, and have Saturday afternoons
together. "Don't you mind it, Hazzy Dazzy," she
said, coming close up to me, and putting her little arms coaxingly
round my neck; "we love each other, and it's ever
so nice now."</p>

<p>I wonder what the reason is that it is one of the first
movements of affectionate feeling to change the name of
the loved one. Give a baby a name, ever so short and ever
so musical, where is the mother that does not twist it into
some other pet name between herself and her child. So Susie,
when she was very loving, called me Hazzy, and sometimes
would play on my name, and call me Hazzy Dazzy, and sometimes
Dazzy, and we laughed at this because it was between
us; and we amused ourselves with thinking how surprised
people would be to hear her say Dazzy, and how they
would wonder who she meant. In like manner, I used to call
her Daisy when we were by ourselves, because she seemed to
me so neat and trim and pure, and wore a little flat hat on
Sundays just like a daisy.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Daisy," said I, "just what I'm going to do&mdash;I'm
going to grow strong as Sampson did."</p>

<p>"Oh, but how can you?" she suggested, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going to run and jump and climb, and carry ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
so much water for Mother, and I'm to ride on horseback
and go to mill, and go all round on errands, and so I shall
get to be a man fast, and when I get to be a man I'll build
a house all on purpose for you and me&mdash;I'll build it all myself;
it shall have a parlor and a dining-room and kitchen,
and bed-room, and well-room, and chambers"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And nice closets to put things in," suggested the little
woman.</p>

<p>"Certainly, ever so many&mdash;just where you want them,
there I'll put them," said I, with surpassing liberality. "And
then, when we live together, I'll take care of you&mdash;I'll keep
off all the lions and bears and panthers. If a bear should
come at <em>you</em>, Daisy, I should tear him right in two, just
as Sampson did."</p>

<p>At this vivid picture, Daisy nestled close to my shoulder,
and her eyes grew large and reflective. "We shouldn't
leave poor Mother alone," said she.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; she shall come and live with us," said I, with an
exalted generosity. "I will make her a nice chamber on
purpose, and <em>my</em> mother shall come, too."</p>

<p>"But she can't leave your father, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, father shall come, too&mdash;when he gets old and can't
preach any more. I shall take care of them all."</p>

<p>And my little Daisy looked at me with eyes of approving
credulity, and said I was a brave boy; and the bobolinks
chittered and chattered applause as they sung and skirmished
and whirled up over the meadow grasses; and by and by,
when the sun fell low, and looked like a great golden ball,
with our hands full of lilies, and our baskets full of strawberries,
we climbed over the old wall, and toddled home.</p>

<p>After that, I remember many gay and joyous passages
in that happiest summer of my life. How, when autumn
came, we roved through the woods together, and gathered
such stores of glossy brown chestnuts. What joy it was to
us to scuff through the painted fallen leaves and send them
flying like showers of jewels before us! How I reconnoitered
and marked available chestnut trees, and how I gloried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
being able to climb like a cat, and get astride high limbs
and shake and beat them, and hear the glossy brown nuts
fall with a rich, heavy thud below, while Susie was busily
picking up at the foot of the tree. How she did flatter me
with my success and prowess! Tom Halliday might be a
bigger boy, but he could never go up a tree as I could; and
as for that great clumsy Jim Fellows, she laughed to
think what a figure he would make, going out on the end
of the small limbs, which would be sure to break and send
him bundling down. The picture which Susie drew of the
awkwardness of the big boys often made us laugh till the
tears rolled down our cheeks. To this day I observe it as a
weakness of my sex that we all take it in extremely good
part when the pretty girl of our heart laughs at other fellows
in a snug, quiet way, just between one's dear self and
herself alone. We encourage our own dear little cat to
scratch and claw the sacred memories of Jim or Tom, and
think that she does it in an extremely cunning and diverting
way&mdash;it being understood between us that there is no
malice in it&mdash;that "Jim and Tom are nice fellows enough,
you know&mdash;only that somebody else is so superior to them,"
etc.</p>

<p>Susie and I considered ourselves as an extremely forehanded,
well-to-do partnership, in the matter of gathering in our
autumn stores. No pair of chipmonks in the neighborhood
conducted business with more ability. We had a famous
cellar that I dug and stoned, where we stored away our
spoils. We had chestnuts and walnuts and butternuts, as
we said, to last us all winter, and many an earnest consultation
and many a busy hour did the gathering and arranging
of these spoils cost us.</p>

<p>Then, oh, the golden times we had when father's barrels of
new cider came home from the press! How I cut and gathered
and selected bunches of choice straws, which I took to
school and showed to Susie, surreptitiously, at intervals, during
school exercises, that she might see what a provision of
bliss I was making for Saturday afternoons. How Susie was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
sent to visit us on these occasions, in leather shoes and
checked apron, so that we might go in the cellar; and how,
mounted up on logs on either side of a barrel of cider,
we plunged our straws through the foamy mass at the bung-hole,
and drew out long draughts of sweet cider! I was sure
to get myself dirty in my zeal, which she never did; and
then she would laugh at me and patronize me, and wipe me
up in a motherly sort of way. "How <em>do</em> you always get so
dirty, Harry?" she would say, in a truly maternal tone of reproof.
"How <em>do</em> you keep so clean?" I would say, in wonder;
and she would laugh, and call me her dear, dirty boy.
She would often laugh at me, the little elf, and make herself
distractingly merry at my expense, but the moment she saw
that the blood was getting too high in my cheeks, she would
stroke me down with praises, as became a wise young daughter
of Eve.</p>

<p>Besides all this, she had her little airs of moral superiority,
and used occasionally to lecture me in the nicest manner.
Being an only darling, she herself was brought up in the
strictest ways in which little feet could go; and the nicety
of her conscience was as unsullied as that of her dress. I
was hot tempered and heady, and under stress of great provocation
would come as near swearing as a minister's son
could possibly do. When the big boys ravaged our house
under the tree, or threw sticks at us, I used to stretch every
permitted limit, and scream, "Darn you!" and "Confound
you!" with a vigor and emphasis that made it almost equal
to something a good deal stronger.</p>

<p>On such occasions Susie would listen pale and frightened,
and, when reason came back to me, gravely lecture me,
and bring me into the paths of virtue. She used to rehearse
to me the teachings of her mother about all manner of good
things.</p>

<p>I have her image now in my mind, looking so crisp and
composed and neat in her sobriety, repeating, for my edification,
the hymn which contained the good child's ideal in
those days:</p>

<p>I can hear now the delicious lisp of my little saint, and
see the gracious gravity of her manner. To my mind, she
was unaccountably well established in the ways of virtue,
and I listened to her little lectures with a secret reverence.</p>

<p>Susie was especially careful in the observation of Sunday,
and as that is a point where children are apt to be
particularly weak, she would exhort me to rigorous exactitude.</p>

<p>I kept it, first, by thinking that I should see <em>her</em> at church,
and by growing very precise about my Sunday clothes,
whereat my sisters winked at each other and laughed slyly.
Then at church we sat in great square pews adjoining to
each other. It was my pleasure to peep through the slats at
Susie. She was wonderful to behold then, all in white, with
a profusion of blue ribbons and her little flat hat over her
curls&mdash;and a pair of dainty blue shoes peeping out from her
dress.</p>

<p>She informed me that little girls never must think about
their clothes in meeting, and so I supposed she was trying to
be entirely absorbed from earthly vanities, unconscious of
the fixed and earnest stare with which I followed every
movement.</p>

<p>Human nature is but partially sanctified, however, in little
saints as well as grown up ones, and I noticed that occasionally,
probably by accident, the great blue eyes met mine,
and a smile, almost amounting to a sinful giggle, was with
difficulty choked down. She was, however, a most conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
little puss and recovered herself in a moment, and
looked gravely upward at the minister, not one word of
whose sermon could she by any possibility understand,
severely devoting herself to her religious duties, till exhausted
nature gave way. The little lids would close over
the eyes like blue pimpernel before a shower,&mdash;the head
would drop and nod, till finally the mother would dispense
the little Christian from further labors, by laying her head
on her lap and drawing her feet up comfortably upon the
seat, to sleep out to the end of the sermon.</p>

<p>When winter came on I beset my older brother to make
me a sled. Sleds, such as every boy in Boston or New York
now rejoices in, were blessings in our parts unknown; our
sled was of rough, domestic manufacture.</p>

<p>My brother, laughing, asked if my sled was intended to
draw Susie on, and on my earnest response in the affirmative
he amused himself with painting it in colors, red and blue,
most glorious to behold.</p>

<p>My soul was magnified within me when I first started
with this stylish establishment to wait on Susie.</p>

<p>What young fellow does not exult in a smart team when
he has a girl whom he wants to dazzle? Great was my joy
and pride when I first stopped at Susie's and told her to
hurry on her things, for I had come to draw her to school!</p>

<p>What a pretty picture she made in her little blue knit
hood and mittens, her bright curls flying and cheeks glowing
with the keen winter air! There was a long hill on the
way to school, and seated on the sled behind her, I careered
gloriously down with exultation in my breast, while a
stream of laughter floated on the breeze behind us. That
was a winter of much coasting down hill, of red cheeks and
red noses, of cold toes, which we never minded, and of abundant
jollity. Susie, under her mother's careful showing,
knit me a pair of red mittens, warming to the heart and
delightful to the eyes; and I piled up wood and carried
water for Mother, and by vigorous economy earned money
enough to buy Susie a great candy heart as big as my two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
hands, that had the picture of two doves tied together by a
blue ribbon on one side, and on the other two very red
hearts skewered together by an arrow.</p>

<p>No work of art ever gave greater and more unmingled
delight. Susie gave it a prominent place in her baby-house,&mdash;and
though it was undeniably sweet, as certain little nibbling
trials on its edges had proved, yet the artistic sense
was stronger than the palate, and the candy heart was kept
to be looked at and rejoiced in.</p>

<p>Susie's mother was an intimate and confidential friend of
my mother, and a most docile and confiding sheep of my
father's flock. She regarded her minister's family, and all
that belonged to it, as something set apart and sacred. My
mother had imparted to her the little joke of my matrimonial
wishes, and the two matrons had laughed over it together,
and then sighed, and said, "Ah! well, stranger
things have happened." Susie's mother told how she used
to know her husband when he was a little boy, and what if
it should be! and then they strayed on to the general truth
that this was a world of uncertainty, and we never can tell
what a day may bring forth.</p>

<p>Our little idyl, too, was rather encouraged by my brothers
and sisters, who made a pet and plaything of Susie, and
diverted themselves by the gravity and honesty with which
we devoted ourselves to each other. Oh! dear ignorant
days&mdash;sweet little child-Eden&mdash;why could it not last?</p>

<p>But it could not. It was fleeting as the bobolink's song,
as the spotted yellow lilies, as the grass and daisies. My
little Daisy was too dear to the angels to be spared to grow
up in our coarse world.</p>

<p>The winter passed and spring came, and Susie and I
rejoiced in the first bluebird, and found blue and white violets
together, and went to school together, till the heats of
summer came on. Then a sad epidemic began to linger
around in our mountains, and to be heard of in neighboring
villages, and my poor Daisy was scorched by its breath.</p>

<p>I remember well our last afternoon together in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
meadow, where, the year before, we had gathered strawberries.
We went down into it in high spirits; the strawberries
were abundant, and we chatted and picked together
gaily, till Daisy began to complain that her head ached
and her throat was sore. I sat her down by the brook, and
wet her curls with the water, and told her to rest there, and
let me pick for her. But pretty soon she called me. She
was crying with pain. "Oh! Hazzy, dear, I must go home,"
she said. "Take me to Mother." I hurried to help her, for
she cried and moaned so that I was frightened. I began to
cry, too, and we came up the steps of her mother's house
sobbing together.</p>

<p>When her mother came out the little one suppressed her
tears and distress for a moment, and turning, threw her
arms around my neck and kissed me. "Don't cry any more,
Hazzy," she said; "we'll see each other again."</p>

<p>Her mother took her up in her arms and carried her in,
and I never saw my little baby-wife again on this earth!
Not where the daisies and buttercups grew; nor where the
golden lilies shook their bells, and the bobolinks trilled;
not in the school-room, with its many child-voices; not in
the old square pew in church&mdash;never, never more that trim
little maiden form, those violet blue eyes, those golden curls
of hair, were to be seen on earth!</p>

<p>My Daisy's last kisses, with the fever throbbing in her
veins, very nearly took me with her. From that time I have
only indistinct remembrances of going home crying, of turning
with a strange loathing from my supper, of creeping up
and getting into bed, shivering and burning, with a thumping
and beating pain in my head.</p>

<p>The next morning the family doctor pronounced me a case
of the epidemic (scarlet fever) which he said was all about
among children in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>I have dim, hot, hazy recollections of burning, thirsty,
head-achey days, when I longed for cold water, and could
not get a drop, according to the good old rules of medical
practice in those times. I dimly observed different people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sitting up with me every night, and putting different medicines
in my unresisting mouth; and day crept slowly after
day, and I lay idly watching the rays of sunlight and flutter
of leaves on the opposite wall.</p>

<p>One afternoon, I remember, as I lay thus listless, I heard
the village bell strike slowly&mdash;six times. The sound wavered
and trembled with long and solemn intervals of shivering
vibration between. It was the numbering of my
Daisy's little years on earth,&mdash;the announcement that she
had gone to the land where time is no more measured by
day and night, for there shall be no night there.</p>

<p>When I was well again I remember my mother told me
that my little Daisy was in heaven, and I heard it with a
dull, cold chill about my heart, and wondered that I could
not cry.</p>

<p>I look back now into my little heart as it was then, and
remember the paroxysms of silent pain I used to have at
times, deep within, while yet I seemed to be like any other
boy.</p>

<p>I heard my sisters one day discussing whether I cared
much for Daisy's death.</p>

<p>"He don't seem to, much," said one.</p>

<p>"Oh, children are little animals, they forget what's out
of sight," said another.</p>

<p>But I did not forget,&mdash;I could not bear to go to the
meadow where we gathered strawberries,&mdash;to the chestnut
trees where we had gathered nuts,&mdash;and oftentimes, suddenly,
in work or play, that smothering sense of a past,
forever gone, came over me like a physical sickness.</p>

<p>When children grow up among older people and are
pushed and jostled, and set aside in the more engrossing
interests of their elders, there is an almost incredible amount
of timidity and dumbness of nature, with regard to the
expression of inward feeling,&mdash;and yet, often at this time the
instinctive sense of pleasure and pain is fearfully acute.
But the child has imperfectly learned language. His stock
of words, as yet, consists only in names and attributes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
outward and physical objects, and he has no phraseology
with which to embody a mere emotional experience.</p>

<p>What I felt when I thought of my little playfellow, was a
dizzying, choking rush of bitter pain and anguish. Children
can feel this acutely as men and women,&mdash;but even in mature
life this experience has no gift of expression.</p>

<p>My mother alone, with the divining power of mothers,
kept an eye on me. "Who knows," she said to my father,
"but this death may be a heavenly call to him."</p>

<p>She sat down gently by my bed one night and talked with
me of heaven, and the brightness and beauty there, and told
me that little Susie was now a fair white angel.</p>

<p>I remember shaking with a tempest of sobs.</p>

<p>"But I want her <em>here</em>," I said. "I want to see her."</p>

<p>My mother went over all the explanations in the premises,&mdash;all
that can ever be said in such cases, but I only sobbed
the more.</p>

<p>"<em>I can't see her!</em> Oh mother, mother!"</p>

<p>That night I sobbed myself to sleep and dreamed a blessed
dream.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I was again in our meadow, and that
it was fairer than ever before; the sun shone gaily, the sky
was blue, and our great, golden lily stocks seemed mysteriously
bright and fair, but I was wandering lonesome and
solitary. Then suddenly my little Daisy came running to
meet me in her pink dress and white apron, with her golden
curls hanging down her neck. "Oh Daisy, Daisy!" said I
running up to her. "Are you alive?&mdash;they told me that you
were dead."</p>

<p>"No, Hazzy, dear, I am not dead,&mdash;never you believe that,"
she said, and I felt the clasp of her soft little arms round
my neck. "Didn't I tell you we'd see each other again?"</p>

<p>"But they told me you were dead," I said in wonder&mdash;and
I thought I held her off and looked at her,&mdash;she laughed
gently at me as she often used to, but her lovely eyes had a
mysterious power that seemed to thrill all through me.</p>

<p>"I am not dead, dear Hazzy," she said. "We never die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
were I am&mdash;I shall love you always," and with that my
dream wavered and grew misty as when clear water breaks
an image into a thousand glassy rings and fragments.</p>

<p>I thought I heard lovely music, and felt soft, clasping
arms, and I awoke with a sense of being loved and pitied,
and comforted.</p>

<p>I cannot describe the vivid, penetrating sense of reality
which this dream left behind it. It seemed to warm my
whole life, and to give back to my poor little heart something
that had been rudely torn away from it. Perhaps
there is no reader that has not had experiences of the
wonderful power which a dream often exercises over the
waking hours for weeks after&mdash;and it will not appear incredible
that after that, instead of shunning the meadow
where we used to play, it was my delight to wander there
alone, to gather the strawberries&mdash;tend the birds' nests, and
lie down on my back in the grass and look up into the blue
sky through an overarching roof of daisies, with a strange
sort of feeling of society, as if my little Daisy were with me.</p>

<p>And is it not perhaps so? Right along side of this
troublous life, that is seen and temporal, may lie the green
pastures and the still waters of the unseen and eternal, and
they who know us better than we know them, can at any
time step across that little rill that we call Death, to minister
to our comfort.</p>

<p>For what are these child-angels made, that are sent down
to this world to bring so much love and rapture, and go
from us in such bitterness and mourning? If we believe
in Almighty Love we must believe that they have a merciful
and tender mission to our wayward souls. The love
wherewith we love them is something the most utterly pure
and unworldly of which human experience is capable, and
we must hope that every one who goes from us to the world
of light, goes holding an invisible chain of love by which to
draw us there.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think I would never have had my little
Daisy grow older on our earth. The little child dies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
growing into womanhood, and often the woman is far less
lovely than the little child. It seems to me that lovely and
loving childhood, with its truthfulness, its frank sincerity,
its pure, simple love, is so sweet and holy an estate that it
would be a beautiful thing in heaven to have a band of
heavenly children, guileless, gay and forever joyous&mdash;tender
Spring blossoms of the Kingdom of Light. Was it of such
whom he had left in his heavenly home our Saviour was
thinking, when he took little children up in his arms and
blessed them, and said, "Of such is the Kingdom of
Heaven?"</p>

<p class="ph3">MY SHADOW-WIFE.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My</span> Shadow Wife! Is there then substance in shadow?
Yea, there may be. A shadow&mdash;a spiritual
presence&mdash;may go with us where mortal footsteps
cannot go; walk by our side amid the roar of the city: talk
with us amid the sharp clatter of voices; come to us through
closed doors, as we sit alone over our evening fire; counsel,
bless, inspire us; and though the figure cannot be clasped
in mortal arms&mdash;though the face be veiled&mdash;yet this wife of
the future may have a power to bless, to guide, to sustain
and console. Such was the dream-wife of my youth.</p>

<p>Whence did she come? She rose like a white, pure mist
from that little grave. She formed herself like a cloud-maiden
from the rain and dew of those first tears.</p>

<p>When we look at the apparent recklessness with which
great sorrows seem to be distributed among the children of
the earth, there is no way to keep our faith in a Fatherly
love, except to recognize how invariably the sorrows that
spring from love are a means of enlarging and dignifying a
human being. Nothing great or good comes without birth-pangs,
and in just the proportion that natures grow more
noble, their capacities of suffering increase.</p>

<p>The bitter, silent, irrepressible anguish of that childish bereavement
was to me the awakening of a spiritual nature.
The little creature who, had she lived, might have grown
up perhaps into a common-place woman, became a fixed star
in the heaven-land of the ideal, always drawing me to look
upward. My memories of her were a spring of refined and
tender feeling, through all my early life. I could not then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
write; but I remember that the overflow of my heart
towards her memory required expression, and I taught myself
a strange kind of manuscript, by copying the letters of
the alphabet. I bought six cents' worth of paper and a
tallow candle at the store, which I used to light surreptitiously
when I had been put to bed nights, and, sitting up
in my little night-gown, I busied myself with writing my
remembrances of her. I could not, for the world, have
asked my mother to let me have a candle in my bed-room
after eight o'clock. I would have died sooner than to explain
why I wanted it. My purchase of paper and candle was my
first act of independent manliness. The money, I reflected,
was mine, because I earned it myself, and the paper was
mine, and the candle was mine, so that I was not using my
father's property in an unwarrantable manner, and thus I
gave myself up to my inspirations. I wrote my remembrances
of her, as she stood among the daisies and the
golden lilies. I wrote down her little words of wisdom and
grave advice, in the queerest manuscript that ever puzzled
a wise man of the East. If one imagines that all this was
spelt phonetically, and not at all in the unspeakable and
astonishing way in which the English language is conventionally
spelt, one may truly imagine that it was something
rather peculiar in the way of literature. But the heart-comfort,
the utter abandonment of soul that went into it, is
something that only those can imagine who have tried the
like and found the relief of it. My little heart was like the
Caspian sea, or some other sea which I read about, which
had found a secret channel by which its waters could pass
off under ground. When I had finished, every evening, I
used to extinguish my candle, and put it and my manuscript
inside of the straw bed on which I slept, which had a long
pocket hole in the centre, secured by buttons, for the purpose
of stirring the straw. Over this I slept in conscious
security, every night; sometimes with blissful dreams of
going to brighter meadows, when I saw my Daisy playing
with whole troops of beautiful children, fair as water lilies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
on the shore of a blue lake. Thus, while I seemed to be like
any other boy, thinking of nothing but my sled, and my bat
and ball, and my mittens, I began to have a little withdrawing
room of my own; another land in which I could walk
and take a kind of delight that nothing visible gave me.
But one day my oldest sister, in making the bed, with
domestic thoroughness, disemboweled my whole store of
manuscripts and the half consumed fragment of my candle.</p>

<p>There is no poetry in housewifery, and my sister at once
took a housewifely view of the proceeding&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, now! is there any end to the conjurations of
boys?" she said. "He might have set the house on fire and
burned us all alive, in our beds!"</p>

<p>Reader, this is quite possible, as I used to perform my
literary labors sitting up in bed, with the candle standing
on a narrow ledge on the side of the bedstead.</p>

<p>Forthwith the whole of my performance was lodged in
my mother's hands&mdash;I was luckily at school.</p>

<p>"Now, girls," said my mother, "keep quiet about this;
above all, don't say a word to the boy. I will speak to
him."</p>

<p>Accordingly, that night after I had gone up to bed, my
mother came into my room and, when she had seen me in
bed, she sat down by me and told me the whole discovery.
I hid my head under the bed clothes, and felt a sort of burning
shame and mortification that was inexpressible; but she
had a good store of that mother's wit and wisdom by which
I was to be comforted. At last she succeeded in drawing
both the bed clothes from my face and the veil from my
heart, and I told her all my little story.</p>

<p>"Dear boy," she said, "you must learn to write, and you
need not buy candles, you shall sit by me evenings and I
will teach you; it was very nice of you to practice all alone;
but it will be a great deal easier to let me teach you the
writing letters."</p>

<p>Now I had begun the usual course of writing copies in
school. In those days it was deemed necessary to commence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
by teaching what was called <i>coarse hand</i>; and I had
filled many dreary pages with m's and n's of a gigantic size;
but it never had yet occurred to me that the writing of
these copies was to bear any sort of relation to the expression
of thoughts and emotions within me that were clamoring
for a vent, while my rude copies of printed letters did
bear to my mind this adaptation. But now my mother
made me sit by her evenings, with a slate and pencil, and,
under her care, I made a cross-cut into the fields of practical
handwriting, and was also saved the dangers of going off
into a morbid habit of feeling, which might easily have
arisen from my solitary reveries.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said to my father, "I told you this one was
to be our brightest. He will make a writer yet," and she
showed him my manuscript.</p>

<p>"You must look after him, Mother," said my father, as he
always said, when there arose any exigency about the children,
that required delicate handling.</p>

<p>My mother was one of that class of women whose power
on earth seems to be only the greater for being a spiritual
and invisible one. The control of such women over men is
like that of the soul over the body. The body is visible,
forceful, obtrusive, self-asserting. The soul invisible, sensitive,
yet with a subtle and vital power which constantly
gains control and holds every inch that it gains.</p>

<p>My father was naturally impetuous, though magnanimous,
hasty tempered and imperious, though conscientious; my
mother united the most exquisite sensibility with the
deepest calm&mdash;calm resulting from habitual communion
with the highest and purest source of all rest&mdash;the peace
that passeth all understanding. Gradually, by this spiritual
force, this quietude of soul, she became his leader and
guide. He held her hand and looked up to her with a
trustful implicitness that increased with every year.</p>

<p>"Where's your mother?" was always the fond inquiry
when he entered the house, after having been off on one of
his long preaching tours or clerical counsels. At all hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
he would burst from his study with fragments of the sermon
or letter he was writing, to read to her and receive her suggestions
and criticisms. With her he discussed the plans
of his discourses, and at her dictation changed, improved,
altered and added; and under the brooding influence of her
mind, new and finer traits of tenderness and spirituality
pervaded his character and his teachings. In fact, my
father once said to me, "She made me by her influence."</p>

<p>In these days, we sometimes hear women, who have reared
large families on small means, spoken of as victims who had
suffered unheard of oppressions. There is a growing materialism
that refuses to believe that there can be happiness
without the ease and facilities and luxuries of wealth.</p>

<p>But my father and mother, though living on a narrow
income, were never really poor. The chief evil of poverty
is the crushing of ideality out of life&mdash;the taking away its
poetry and substituting hard prose;&mdash;and this with them
was impossible. My father loved the work he did, as the
artist loves his painting and the sculptor his chisel. A man
needs less money when he is doing only what he loves to
do&mdash;what, in fact, he <em>must</em> do,&mdash;pay or no pay. St. Paul said,
"A necessity is laid upon me, yea, woe is me, if I preach not
the gospel." Preaching the gospel was his irrepressible
instinct, a necessity of his being. My mother, from her
deep spiritual nature, was one soul with my father in his
life-work. With the moral organization of a prophetess, she
stood nearer to heaven than he, and looking in, told him
what she saw, and he, holding her hand, felt the thrill of
celestial electricity. With such women, life has no prose;
their eyes see all things in the light of heaven, and flowers
of paradise spring up in paths that to unanointed eyes, seem
only paths of toil. I never felt, from anything I saw at
home, from any word or action of my mother's, that we
were poor, in the sense that poverty was an evil. I was
reminded, to be sure, that we were poor in a sense that
required constant carefulness, watchfulness over little
things, energetic habits, and vigorous industry and self-helpfulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
But we were never poor in any sense that restricted
hospitality or made it a burden. In those days, a minister's
house was always the home for all the ministers and
their families, whenever an exigency required of them to
travel, and the spare room of our house never wanted guests
of longer or shorter continuance. But the atmosphere of
the house was such as always made guests welcome. Three
or four times a year, the annual clerical gatherings of the
church filled our house to overflowing and necessitated an
abundant provision and great activity of preparation on the
part of the women of our family. Yet I never heard an
expression of impatience or a suggestion that made me
suppose they felt themselves unduly burdened. My mother's
cheerful face was a welcome and a benediction at all times,
and guests found it good to be with her.</p>

<p>In the midst of our large family, of different ages, of
vigorous growth, of great individuality and forcefulness
of expression, my mother's was the administrative power.
My father habitually referred everything to her, and leaned
on her advice with a childlike dependence. She read the
character of each, she mediated between opposing natures:
she translated the dialect of different sorts of spirits, to
each other. In a family of young children, there is a chance
for every sort and variety of natures; and for natures
whose modes of feeling are as foreign to each other, as
those of the French and the English. It needs a common
interpreter, who understands every dialect of the soul, thus
to translate differences of individuality into a common language
of love.</p>

<p>It has often seemed to me a fair question, on a review of the
way my mother ruled in our family, whether the politics of
the ideal state in a millennial community, should not be one
equally pervaded by mother-influences.</p>

<p>The woman question of our day, as I understand it is this.&mdash;Shall
<span class="smcap">MOTHERHOOD</span> ever be felt in the public administration
of the affairs of state? The state is nothing more nor
less than a collection of families, and what would be good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
or bad for the individual family, would be good or bad for
the state.</p>

<p>Such as our family would have been, ruled only by my
father, without my mother, such the political state is, and
has been; there have been in it "conscript fathers," but no
"conscript mothers;" yet is not a mother's influence needed
in acts that relate to the interests of collected families as
much as in individual ones?</p>

<p>The state, at this very day, needs an influence like what I
remember our mother's to have been, in our great, vigorous,
growing family,&mdash;an influence quiet, calm, warming, purifying,
uniting&mdash;it needs a womanly economy and thrift in husbanding
and applying its material resources&mdash;it needs a
divining power, by which different sections and different
races can be interpreted to each other, and blended together
in love&mdash;it needs an educating power, by which its immature
children may be trained in virtue&mdash;it needs a loving
and redeeming power, by which its erring and criminal
children may be borne with, purified, and led back to virtue.</p>

<p>Yet, while I thus muse, I remember that such women as
my mother are those to whom in an especial manner all
noise and publicity and unrestful conflict are peculiarly
distasteful. My mother had that delicacy of fibre that made
any kind of public exercise of her powers an impossibility.
It is not peculiarly a feminine characteristic, but belongs
equally to many men of the finest natures. It is characteristic
of the poets and philosophers of life. It is ascribed by
the sacred writers to Jesus of Nazareth, in whom an aversion
for publicity and a longing for stillness and retirement
are specially indicated by many touching incidents. Jesus
preferred to form around him a family of disciples and to
act on the world through them, and it is remarkable that
he left no writings directly addressed to the world by himself,
but only by those whom he inspired.</p>

<p>Women of this brooding, quiet, deeply spiritual nature,
while they cannot attend caucuses, or pull political wires or
mingle in the strife of political life, are yet the most needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
force to be for the good of the State. I am persuaded that
<em>it is not till this class of women feel as vital and personal responsibility
for the good of the State, as they have hitherto
felt for that of the family, that we shall gain the final elements
of a perfect society</em>. The laws of Rome, so said the graceful
myth, were dictated to Numa Pompilius, by the nymph,
Egeria. No mortal eye saw her. She was not in the forum,
or the senate. She did not strive, nor cry, nor lift up her
voice in the street, but she made the laws by which Rome
ruled the world. Let us hope in a coming day that not Egeria,
but Mary, the mother of Jesus, the great archetype of the
Christian motherhood, shall be felt through all the laws and
institutions of society. That Mary, who kept all things and
pondered them in her heart&mdash;the silent poet, the prophetess,
the one confidential friend of Jesus, sweet and retired as
evening dew, yet strong to go forth with Christ against the
cruel and vulgar mob, and to stand unfainting by the cross
where He suffered!</p>

<p>From the time that my mother discovered my store of
manuscripts, she came into new and more intimate relation
with me. She took me from the district school, and kept
me constantly with herself, teaching me in the intervals of
domestic avocations.</p>

<p>I was what is called a mother's-boy, as she taught me to
render her all sorts of household services, such as are
usually performed by girls. My two older sisters, about
this time, left us, to establish a seminary in the neighborhood,
and the sister nearest my age went to study under
their care, so that my mother said, playfully, she had no
resource but to make a girl of me. This association with
a womanly nature, and this discipline in womanly ways, I
hold to have been an invaluable part of my early training.
There is no earthly reason which requires a man, in order
to be manly, to be unhandy and clumsy in regard to the
minutiæ of domestic life; and there are quantities of occasions
occurring in the life of every man, in which he will
have occasion to be grateful to his mother, if, like mine, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
trains him in woman's arts and the secrets of making
domestic life agreeable.</p>

<p>But it is not merely in this respect that I felt the value of
my early companionship with my mother. The power of
such women over our sex is essentially the service rendered
us in forming our ideal, and it was by my mother's
influence that the ideal guardian, the "shadow wife," was
formed, that guided me through my youth.</p>

<p>She wisely laid hold of the little idyl of my childhood,
as something which gave her the key to my nature, and
opened before me the hope in my manhood of such a friend
as my little Daisy had been to my childhood. This wife of
the future she often spoke of as a motive. I was to make
myself worthy of her. For her sake I was to be strong, to
be efficient, to be manly and true, and above all pure in
thought and imagination and in word.</p>

<p>The cold mountain air and simple habits of New England
country life are largely a preventive of open immorality;
but there is another temptation which besets the boy,
against which the womanly ideal is the best shield&mdash;the
temptation to vulgarity and obscenity.</p>

<p>It was to my mother's care and teaching I owe it, that
there always seemed to be a lady at my elbow, when
stories were told such as a pure woman would blush to hear.
It was owing to her, that a great deal of what I supposed
to be classical literature both in Greek and Latin and in
English was to me and is to me to this day simply repulsive
and disgusting. I remember that one time when I
was in my twelfth or thirteenth year, one of Satan's agents
put into my hand one of those stories that are written
with an express purpose of demoralizing the young&mdash;stories
that are sent creeping like vipers and rattle-snakes stealthily
and secretly among inexperienced and unguarded boys
hiding in secret corners, gliding under their pillows and
filling their veins with the fever poison of impurity. How
many boys in the most critical period of life are forever
ruined, in body and soul, by the silent secret gliding among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
them of these nests of impure serpents, unless they have a
mother, wise, watchful, and never sleeping, with whom
they are in habits of unreserved intimacy and communion!</p>

<p>I remember that when my mother took from me this book,
it was with an expression of fear and horror which made
a deep impression on me. Then she sat by me that night,
when the shadows were deepening, and told me how the
reading of such books, or the letting of such ideas into my
mind would make me unworthy of the wife she hoped
some day I would win. With a voice of solemn awe she
spoke of the holy mystery of marriage as something so
sacred, that all my life's happiness depended on keeping it
pure, and surrounding it only with the holiest thoughts.</p>

<p>It was more the thrill of her sympathies, the noble poetry
of her nature inspiring mine, than anything she said, that
acted upon me and stimulated me to keep my mind and
memory pure. In the closeness of my communion with her
I seemed to see through her eyes and feel through her nerves,
so that at last a passage in a book or a sentiment uttered
always suggested the idea of what she would think of it.</p>

<p>In our days we have heard much said of the importance of
training women to be wives. Is there not something to be
said on the importance of training men to be husbands?
Is the wide latitude of thought and reading and expression
which has been accorded as a matter of course to the boy
and the young man, the conventionally allowed familiarity
with coarseness and indelicacy, a fair preparation to enable
him to be the intimate companion of a pure woman? For
how many ages has it been the doctrine that man and woman
were to meet in marriage, the one crystal-pure, the other
foul with the permitted garbage of all sorts of uncleansed
literature and license?</p>

<p>If the man is to be the head of the woman, even as Christ
is the head of the Church, should he not be her equal, at
least, in purity?</p>

<p>My shadow-wife grew up by my side under my mother's
creative touch. It was for her I studied, for her I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
toil. The thought of providing for her took the sordid element
out of economy and made it unselfish. She was to be
to me adviser, friend, inspirer, charmer. She was to be my
companion, not alone in one faculty, but through all the
range of my being&mdash;there should be nothing wherein she and
I could not by appreciative sympathy commune together.
As I thought of her, she seemed higher than I. I must love
up and not down, I said. She must stand on a height and I
must climb to her&mdash;she must be a princess worthy of many
toils and many labors. Gradually she became to me a controlling
power.</p>

<p>The thought, of what she would think, closed for me many
a book that I felt she and I could not read together&mdash;her
fair image barred the way to many a door and avenue,
which if a young man enters, he must leave his good angel
behind,&mdash;for her sake I abjured intimacies that I felt she
could not approve, and it was my ambition to keep the
inner temple of my heart and thoughts so pure, that it
might be a worthy resting place for her at last.</p>

<p class="ph3">I START FOR COLLEGE AND MY UNCLE JACOB ADVISES ME.</p>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> time came at last when the sacred habit of intimacy
with my mother was broken, and I was
to leave her for college.</p>

<p>It was the more painful to her, as only a year before, my
father had died, leaving her more than ever dependent on
the society of her children.</p>

<p>My father died as he had lived, rejoicing in his work and
feeling that if he had a hundred lives to live, he would devote
them to the same object for which he had spent that
one&mdash;the preaching of the Gospel. He left to my mother the
homestead and a small farm, which was under the care of
one of my brothers, so that the event of his death made no
change in our family home center, and I was to go to college
and fulfill the hope of his heart and the desire of my
mother's life, in consecrating myself to the work of the
Christian ministry.</p>

<p>My father and mother had always kept sacredly a little
fund laid by for the education of their children; it was the
result of many small savings and self-denials&mdash;but self-denials
so cheerfully and hopefully encountered that they
had almost changed their nature and become preferences.
The family fund for this purpose had been used in turn by
two of my older brothers, who, as soon as they gained an
independent foothold in life, appropriated each his first
earnings to replacing this sum for the use of the next.</p>

<p>It was not, however, a fund large enough to dispense with
the need of a strict economy, and a supplemental self-helpfulness
on our part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The terms in some of our New England colleges are
thoughtfully arranged so that the students can teach for
three of the winter months, and the resources thus gained
help out their college expenses. Thus at the same time they
educate themselves and help to educate others, and they
study with the maturity of mind and the appreciation of the
value of what they are gaining, resulting from a habit of
measuring themselves with the actual needs of life.</p>

<p>The time when the boy goes to college is the time when he
feels manhood to begin. He is no longer a boy, but an unfledged,
undeveloped man&mdash;a creature, half of the past and
half of the future. Yet every one gives him a good word
or a congratulatory shake of the hand on his entrance to
this new plateau of life. It is a time when advice is plenty
as blackberries in August, and often held quite as cheap&mdash;but
nevertheless a young fellow may as well look at what
his elders tell him at this time, and see what he can make
of it.</p>

<p>As I was "our minister's son," all the village thought it
had something to do with my going. "Hallo, Harry, so
you've got into college! Think you'll be as smart a man as
your dad?" said one. "Wa-al, so I hear you're going to college.
Stick to it now. I could a made suthin ef I'd a had
larnin at your age," said old Jerry Smith, who rung the
meeting-house bell, sawed wood, and took care of miscellaneous
gardens for sundry widows in the vicinity.</p>

<p>But the sayings that struck me as most to the purpose
came from my Uncle Jacob.</p>

<p>Uncle Jacob was my mother's brother, and the doctor not
only of our village, but of all the neighborhood for ten miles
round. He was a man celebrated for medical knowledge
through the State, and known by his articles in medical
journals far beyond. He might have easily commanded a
wider and more lucrative sphere of practice by going to
any of the large towns and cities, but Uncle Jacob was a
philosopher and preferred to live in a small quiet way in a
place whose scenery suited him, and where he could act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
precisely as he felt disposed, and carry out all his little
humors and pet ideas without rubbing against conventionalities.</p>

<p>He had a secret adoration for my mother, whom he regarded
as the top and crown of all womanhood, and he
also enjoyed the society of my father, using him as a sort of
whetstone to sharpen his wits on. Uncle Jacob was a
church member in good standing, but in the matter of belief
he was somewhat like a high-mettled horse in a pasture,&mdash;he
enjoyed once in a while having a free argumentative race
with my father all round the theological lot. Away he
would go in full career, dodging definitions, doubling and
turning with elastic dexterity, and sometimes ended by
leaping over all the fences, with most astounding assertions,
after which he would calm down, and gradually suffer
the theological saddle and bridle to be put on him and go
on with edifying paces, apparently much refreshed by his
metaphysical capers.</p>

<p>Uncle Jacob was reported to have a wonderful skill in the
healing craft. He compounded certain pills which were
stated to have most wonderful effects. He was accustomed
to exact that, in order fully to develop their medical properties,
they should be taken after a daily bath, and be followed
immediately by a brisk walk of a specific duration in the
open air. The steady use of these pills had been known to
make wonderful changes in the cases of confirmed invalids,
a fact which Uncle Jacob used to notice with a peculiar
twinkle in the corner of his eye. It was sometimes whispered
that the composition of them was neither more nor
less than simple white sugar with a flavor of some harmless
essence, but upon this subject my Uncle Jacob was impenetrable.
He used to say, with the afore-mentioned waggish
twinkle, that their preparation was his secret.</p>

<p>Uncle Jacob had always had a special favor for me, shown
after his own odd and original manner. He would take me
in his chaise with him when driving about his business, and
keep my mind on a perpetual stretch with his odd questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and droll, suggestive remarks or stories. There was a
shrewd keen quality to all that he said, that stimulated like
a mental tonic, and none the less so for a stinging flavor of
sarcasm and cynicism, that stirred up and provoked one's
self-esteem. Yet as Uncle Jacob was companionable and
loved a listener, I think he was none the less agreeable to
me for this slight touch of his claws. One likes to find
power of any kind&mdash;and he who shows that he can both
scratch and bite effectively, if he holds his talons in sheath,
comes in time to be regarded as a sort of benefactor for his
forbearance: and so, though I got many a shrewd mental
nip and gripe from my Uncle Jacob, I gave on the whole
more heed to his opinion than that of anybody else that I
knew.</p>

<p>From the time that I had been detected with my self-invented
manuscript, up to the period of my going to college,
the expression of my thoughts by writing had always
been a passion with me, and from year to year my mind had
been busy with its own creations, which it was a solace and
amusement for me to record.</p>

<p>Of course there was ever so much crabbed manuscript,
and no less confused, immature thought. I wrote poems,
essays, stories, tragedies, and comedies. I demonstrated
the immortality of the soul. I sustained the future immortality
of the souls of animals. I wrote sonnets and odes,
in whole or in part on almost everything that could be mentioned
in creation.</p>

<p>My mother advised me to make Uncle Jacob my literary
mentor, and the best of my productions were laid under his
eye.</p>

<p>"Poor trash!" he was wont to say, with his usual kindly
twinkle. "But there must be poor trash in the beginning.
We must all eat our peck of dirt, and learn to write sense
by writing nonsense." Then he would pick out here and
there a line or expression which he assured me was "<em>not
bad</em>." Now and then he condescended to tell me that for a
boy of my age, so and so was actually hopeful, and that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
should make something one of these days, which was to me
more encouragement than much more decided praise from
any other quarter.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">UNCLE JACOB'S ADVICE.</p>

<p>"So you are going to college, boy! Well, away with you; there's no use
advising you; you'll do as all the rest do. In one year you'll know more
than your father, your mother, or I, or all your college officers&mdash;in fact,
than the Lord himself."</p></div>
</div>

<p>We all notice that he who is reluctant to praise, whose
commendation is scarce and hard-earned, is he for whose
good word everybody is fighting; he comes at last to be the
judge in the race. After all, the fact which Uncle Jacob
could not disguise, that he had a certain good opinion of
me, in spite of his sharp criticisms and scant praises, made
him the one whose dicta on every subject were the most important
to me.</p>

<p>I went to him in all the glow of satisfaction and the tremble
of self-importance that a boy feels who is taking the
first step into the land of manhood.</p>

<p>I have the image of him now, as he stood with his back to
the fire, and the newspaper in his hand, giving me his last
counsels. A little wiry, keen-looking man, with a blue,
hawk-like eye, a hooked nose, a high forehead, shadowed
with grizzled hair, and a cris-cross of deeply lined wrinkles
in his face.</p>

<p>"So you are going to college, boy! Well, away with you;
there's no use advising you; you'll do as all the rest do. In
one year you'll know more than your father, your mother,
or I, or all your college officers&mdash;in fact, than the Lord himself.
You'll have doubts about the Bible, and think you
could have made a better one. You'll think that if the
Lord had consulted you he could have laid the foundations
of the earth better, and arranged the course of nature to
more purpose. In short, you'll be a god, knowing good and
evil, and running all over creation measuring everybody
and everything in your pint cup. There'll be no living with
you. But you'll get over it,&mdash;it's only the febrile stage of
knowledge. But if you have a good constitution, you'll
come through with it."</p>

<p>I humbly suggested to him that I should try to keep clear
of the febrile stage; that forewarned was forearmed.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>"Oh, tut! tut! you must go through your fooleries. These
are the regular diseases, the chicken-pox, measles, and
mumps of young manhood; you'll have them all. We only
pray that you may have them light, and not break your constitution
for all your life through, by them. For instance,
you'll fall in love with some baby-faced young thing, with
pink cheeks and long eyelashes, and goodness only knows
what abominations of sonnets you'll be guilty of. That
isn't fatal, however. Only don't get engaged. Take it as
the chicken-pox&mdash;keep your pores open, and don't get cold,
and it'll pass off and leave you none the worse."</p>

<p>"And she!" said I, indignantly. "You talk as if it was
no matter what became of her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, the baby? Oh, she'll outgrow it, too. The fact
is, soberly and seriously, Harry, marriage is the thing that
makes or mars a man; it's the gate through which he goes
up or down, and you shouldn't pledge yourself to it till you
come to your full senses. Look at your mother, boy; see
what a woman may be; see what she was to your father,
what she is to me, to you, to every one that knows her.
Such a woman, to speak reverently, is a pearl of great
price; a man might well sell all he had to buy her. But it
isn't that kind of woman that flirts with college boys. You
don't pick up such pearls every day."</p>

<p>Of course I declared that nothing was further from my
thoughts than anything of that nature.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Harry, you can't afford fooleries," said my
uncle. "You have your own way to make, and nothing to
make it with but your own head and hands, and you must
begin now to count the cost of everything. You have a
healthy, sound body; see that you take care of it. God gives
you a body but once. He don't take care of it for you,
and whatever of it you lose, you lose for good. Many a
chap goes into college fresh as you are, and comes out with
weak eyes and crooked back, yellow complexion and dyspeptic
stomach. He has only himself to thank for it. When
you get to college they'll want you to smoke, and you'll
want to, just for idleness and good fellowship. Now, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
you begin, just calculate what it'll cost you. You can't
get a good cigar under ten cents, and your smoker wants
three a day, at the least. There go thirty cents a day, two
dollars and ten cents a week, or a hundred and nine dollars
and twenty cents a year. Take the next ten years at that
rate, and you can invest over a thousand dollars in tobacco
smoke. That thousand dollars, invested in a savings bank,
would give a permanent income of sixty dollars a year,&mdash;a
handy thing, as you'll find, just as you are beginning life.
Now, I know you think all this is prosy; You are amazingly
given to figures of rhetoric, but, after all, you've got to get
on in a world where things go by the rules of arithmetic."</p>

<p>"Well, uncle," I said, a little nettled, "I pledge you my
word that I won't smoke or drink. I never have done
either, and I don't know why I should."</p>

<p>"Good for you! your hand on that, my boy. You don't
need either tobacco or spirits any more than you need water
in your shoes. There's no danger in doing without them,
and great danger in doing with them; so let's look on that
as settled.</p>

<p>"Now, as to the rest. You have a faculty for stringing
words together, and a hankering after it, that may make or
spoil you. Many a fellow comes to naught because he can
string pretty phrases and turn a good line of poetry. He
gets the notion that he's to be a poet, or orator, or genius of
some sort, and neglects study. Now, Harry, remember that
an empty bag can't stand upright; and that if you are ever
to be a writer you must have something to say, and that
you've got to dig for knowledge as for hidden treasure.
A genius <em>for hard work</em> is the best kind of genius. Look at
great writers, and see how many had it. What a student
Milton was, and Goethe! Great fellows, those!&mdash;like trees
that grow out in a pasture lot, with branches all round.
Composition is the flowering out of a man's mind. When
he has made growth, all studies and all learning, all that
makes woody fibre, go into it. Now, study books; observe
nature; practice. If you make a good firm mental growth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
I hope to see some blossoms and fruits from it one of these
days. So go your ways, and God bless you!"</p>

<p>The last words were said as Uncle Jacob slipped into my
hand an envelope, containing a sum of money. "You'll
need it," he said, "to furnish your room; and hark'e! if
you get into any troubles that you don't want to burden
your mother with, come to me."</p>

<p>There was warmth in the grip with which these last
words were said, and a sort of misty moisture came over
his keen blue eye,&mdash;little signs which meant as much from
his shrewd and reticent nature as a caress or an expression
of tenderness might from another.</p>

<p>My mother's last words, after hours of talk over the evening
fire, were these: "I want you to be a <em>good</em> man. A
great many have tried to be great men, and failed; but
nobody ever sincerely tried to be a <em>good</em> man, and failed."</p>

<p>I suppose it is about the happiest era in a young fellow's
life, when he goes to college for the first time.</p>

<p>The future is all a land of blue distant mists and shadows,
radiant as an Italian landscape. The boundaries between
the possible and the not possible are so charmingly vague!
There is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow forever
waiting for each new comer. Generations have not exhausted
it!</p>

<p>De Balzac said, of writing his novels, that the dreaming
out of them was altogether the best of it. "To imagine,"
he said, "is to smoke enchanted cigarettes; to bring out
one's imaginations into words,&mdash;that is <em>work</em>!"</p>

<p>The same may be said of the romance of one's life. The
dream-life is beautiful, but the rendering into reality quite
another thing.</p>

<p>I believe every boy who has a good father and mother,
goes to college meaning, in a general way, to be a good fellow.
He will not disappoint them.&mdash;No! a thousand times,
no! In the main, he will be a good boy,&mdash;not that he is
going <em>quite</em> to walk according to the counsels of his elders.
He is not going to fall over any precipices&mdash;not he&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
he is going to walk warily and advisedly along the edge
of them, and take a dispassionate survey of the prospect,
and gather a few botanical specimens here and there. It
might be dangerous for a less steady head than his; but he
understands himself, and with regard to all things he says,
"We shall see." The world is full of possibilities and open
questions. Up sail, and away; let us test them!</p>

<p>As I scaled the mountains and descended the valleys on
my way to college, I thought over all that my mother and
Uncle Jacob had said to me, and had my own opinion of it.</p>

<p>Of course I was not the person to err in the ways he had
suggested. I was not to be the dupe of a boy and girl flirtation.
My standard of manhood was too exalted, I reflected,
and I thought with complacency how little Uncle
Jacob knew of me.</p>

<p>To be sure, it is a curious kind of a thought to a young
man, that somewhere in this world, unknown to him, and
as yet unknowing him, lives the woman that is to be his
earthly fate,&mdash;to affect, for good or evil, his destiny.</p>

<p>We have all read the pretty story about the Princess of
China and the young Prince of Tartary, whom a fairy and
genius in a freak of caprice showed to each other in an enchanted
sleep, and then whisked away again, leaving them
to years of vain pursuit and wanderings. Such is the ideal
image of <em>somebody</em>, who must exist <em>somewhere</em>, and is to be
found <em>sometime</em>, and when found, is to be ours.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jacob is all right in the main," I said; "but if I
should meet the true woman even in my college days, why
that, indeed, would be quite another thing."</p>

<p class="ph3">MY DREAM-WIFE</p>


<div>  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">All</span> things prospered with me in my college life. I
had a sunny room commanding a fine prospect,
and uncle Jacob's parting liberality enabled me
to furnish it commodiously.</p>

<p>I bought the furniture of a departing senior at a reduced
price, and felt quite the spirit of a householder in my possessions.
I was well prepared on my studies and did not
find my tasks difficult.</p>

<p>My stock of interior garnishment included several French
lithographs, for the most part of female heads, looking up,
with very dark bright eyes, or looking down, with very long
dark eyelashes.</p>

<p>These heads of dream-women are, after all, not to be
laughed at; they show the yearning for womanly influences
and womanly society which follows the young man in his
enforced monastic seclusion from all family life and family
atmosphere. These little fanciful French lithographs, generally,
are chosen for quite other than artistic reasons. If
we search into it we shall find that one is selected because
it is like sister "Nell," and another puts one in mind of
"Bessie," and then again, there is another "like a girl I
used to know." Now and then one of them has such a
piquant, provoking air of individuality, that one is sure
it must have been sketched from nature. Some teasing,
coaxing, "don't-care-what-you-think" sort of a sprite,
must have wreathed poppies and blue corn-flowers just so
in her hair, and looked gay defiance at the artist who drew
it. There was just such a saucy, spirited gipsy over my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
mantel piece, who seemed to defy me to find her if I
searched the world over&mdash;with whom I held sometimes
airy colloquies&mdash;not in the least was she like my dream-wife,
but I liked her for all that, and thought I would
"give something" to know what she would have to say to
me, just for the curiosity of the thing.</p>

<p>The college was in a little village, and there was no particular
amity between the townspeople and the students.
I believe it is the understanding in such cases, that college
students are to be regarded and treated as a tribe of Bedouin
Arabs, whose hand is against every man, and they in
their turn are not backward to make good the character.
Public opinion shuts them up together&mdash;they are a state
within a state&mdash;with a public sentiment, laws, manners,
and modes of thinking of their own. It is a state, too,
without women. When we think of this, and remember
that all this experience is gone through in the most gaseous
and yeasty period of human existence, we no longer wonder
that there are college rows and scrapes, that all sort of
grotesque capers become hereditary and traditional; that
an apple-cart occasionally appears on top of one of the
steeples, that cannon balls are rolled surreptitiously down the
college stairs, and that tutors' doors are mysteriously found
locked at recitation hours. One simply wonders that the
roof is not blown off, and the windows out, by the combined
excitability of so many fermenting natures.</p>

<p>There is a tendency now in society to open the college
course equally to women&mdash;to continue through college life
that interaction of the comparative influence of the sexes
which is begun in the family.</p>

<p>To a certain extent this experiment has been always
favorably tried in the New England rural Academies, where
young men are fitted for college in the same classes and
studies with women.</p>

<p>In these time-honored institutions, young women have
kept step with young men in the daily pursuit of science,
not only without disorder or unseemly scandal, but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
manifestly more quietness and refinement of manner than
obtains in institutions where female association ceases altogether.
The presence of a couple of dozen of well-bred
ladies in the lecture and recitation rooms of a college would
probably be a preventive of many of the unseemly and
clumsy jokes wherewith it has been customary to diversify
the paths of science, to the affliction of the souls of professors.</p>

<p>But for us boys, there was no gospel of womanhood except
what was to be got from the letters of mothers and sisters,
and such imperfect and flitting acquaintance as we
could pick up in the streets with the girls of the village.
Now though there might be profit, could young men and
women see each other daily under the responsibility of serious
business, keeping step with one another in higher studies,
yet it by no means follows that this kind of flitting
glimpse-like acquaintance, formed merely in the exchange
of a few outside superficialities, can have any particularly
good effect. No element of true worthy friendship, of sober
appreciation, or manly or womanly good sense, generally
enters into these girl-and-boy flirtations, which are the
only substitute for family association during the barren
years of student life. The students were not often invited
into families, and those who gained a character as ladies'
men were not favorably looked upon by our elders. Now
and then by rare and exceptional good luck a college student
is made at home in some good family, where there is
a nice kind mother and the wholesome atmosphere of human
life; or, he forms the acquaintance of some woman,
older and wiser than himself, who can talk with him on all
the multitude of topics his college studies suggest. But
such cases are only exceptions. In general there is no
choice between flirtation and monastic isolation.</p>

<p>For my part, I posed myself on the exemplary platform,
and remembering my uncle Jacob's advice, contemplated
life with the grim rigidity of a philosopher. I was going to
have no trifling, and surveyed the girls at church, on Sunday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with a distant and severe air&mdash;as gay creatures of an
hour, who could hold no place in my serious meditations.
Plato or Aristotle, in person, could not have contemplated
life and society from a more serene height of composure.
I was favorably known by my teachers, and held rank at
the head of my class, and was stigmatized as a "dig," by
frisky young gentlemen who enjoyed rolling cannon balls
down stairs&mdash;taking the tongue out of the chapel bell&mdash;greasing
the seats, and other thread-bare college jokes,
which they had not genius enough to vary, so as to give
them a spice of originality.</p>

<p>But one bright June Sunday&mdash;just one of those days that
seem made to put all one's philosophy into confusion, when
apple-blossoms were bursting their pink shells, and robins
singing, and leaves twittering and talking to each other in
undertones, there came to me a great revelation.</p>

<p>How innocently I brushed my hair and tied my neck tie,
on that fateful morning, contemplating my growing moustache
and whiskers hopefully in the small square of looking-glass
which served for me these useful purposes of
self-knowledge. I looked at my lineaments as those of a
free young junior, without fear and without anxiety, without
even an incipient inquiry what anybody else would
think of them&mdash;least of all any woman&mdash;and marched forth
obediently and took my wonted seat in that gallery of the
village church which was assigned to the college students
of Congregational descent; where, like so many sheep in
a pen, we joined in the services of the common sheep-fold.</p>

<p>I suppose there is moral profit even in the decent self-denial
of such weekly recurring religious exercises. To be
forced to a certain period of silence, order, quiet, and to
have therein a possibility and a suggestion of communion
with a Higher Power, and an out-look into immortality, is
something not to be undervalued in education, and justifies
the stringency with which our New England colleges preserve
and guard this part of their régime.</p>

<p>But it was to be confessed in our case, that the number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
who really seemed to have any spiritual participation or
sympathy in the great purposes of the exercises, was not a
majority. A general, dull decency of demeanor was the
most frequent attainment, and such small recreations were
in vogue as could be pursued without drawing the attention
of the monitors. There was some telegraphy of
eyes between the girls of the village and some of the more
society-loving fellows, who had cultivated intimacies in
that quarter; there were some novels, stealthily introduced
and artfully concealed and read by the owner, while his
head, resting on the seat before him, seemed bowed in
devotion; and some artistic exercises in sketching caricatures
on the part of others. For my own part, having been
trained religiously, I gave strict outward and decorous attention;
but the fact was that my mind generally sailed off
on some cloud of fancy, and wandered through dream-land,
so that not a word of anything present reached my ear.
This habit of reverie and castle-building, repressed all the
week by the severe necessity of definite tasks, came upon
me Sundays as Bunyan describes the hot, sleepy atmosphere
of the enchanted ground.</p>

<p>Our pastor was a good man, who wrote a kind of smooth,
elegant, unexceptionable English; whose measured cadences
and easy flow, were, to use the scripture language, as a
"very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and
can play sweetly upon an instrument." I heard him as
one hears murmurs and voices through one's sleep, while my
spirit went everywhere under the sun. I traveled in foreign
lands, I saw pictures, cathedrals; I had thrilling adventures
and hair-breadth escapes; formed strange and exciting acquaintances;
in short, was the hero of a romance, whose
scenes changed as airily and easily as the sunset clouds of
evening. So really and so vividly did this supposititious life
excite me that I have actually found myself with tears in
my eyes through the pathos of these unsubstantial visions.</p>

<p>It was in one of the lulling pauses of such a romance,
while I yet heard the voice of our good pastor proving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that "selfishness was the essence of moral evil," that I lifted
up my eyes, and became for the first time conscious of a
new face, in the third pew of the broad aisle below me.
It was a new one&mdash;one that certainly had never been there
before, and was altogether just the face to enter into the
most ethereal perceptions of my visionary life. I started with
a sort of awakening thrill, such, perhaps, as Adam had
when he woke from his sleep and saw his Eve. There, to
be sure, was the face of my dream-wife, incarnate and
visible! That face, so refined, so spiritual, so pure! a baptized,
Christianized Greek face! A cross between Venus
and the Virgin Mary! The outlines were purely, severely
classical, such as I have since seen in the Psyche of the
Naples gallery; but the large, tremulous, pathetic eyes
redeemed them from statuesque coldness. They were eyes
that <em>thought</em>, that looked deep into life, death, and eternity&mdash;so
I said to myself as I gazed down on her, and held
my breath with a kind of religious awe. The vision was all
in white, as such visions must be, and the gauzy crape bonnet
with its flowers upon her head, dissolved under my
eyes into a sort of sacred aureole, such as surrounds the
heads of saints. I saw her, and only her, through the remaining
hour of church. I studied every movement. The
radiant eyes were fixed upon the minister, and with an
expression so sadly earnest that I blushed for my own
wandering thoughts, and began to endeavor to turn my
mind to the truths I was hearing told; but, after all, I
thought more about her than the discourse. I saw her
search the hymn-book for the hymn, and wished that I
were down there to find it for her. I saw her standing
up, and looking down at her hymns with the wonderful eyes
veiled by long lashes, and singing&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>How miserably gross, and worldly, and unworthy I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
at that moment! How I longed for an ideal, superhuman
spirituality,&mdash;something that should make me worthy to
touch the hem of her garment!</p>

<p>When the blessing was pronounced, I hastened down and
stood where I might see her as she passed out of church.
I had not been alone in my discoveries: there had been
dozens of others that saw the same star, and there were
whisperings, and elbowings, and consultings, as a knot of
juniors and seniors stationed themselves as I had done,
to see her pass out.</p>

<p>As she passed by she raised her eyes slowly, and as it
were by accident, and they fell like a ray of sunlight on one
of our number,&mdash;Jim Fellows&mdash;who immediately bowed.
A slight pink flush rose in her cheeks as she gracefully
returned the salutation, and passed on. Jim was instantly
the great man of the hour; he knew her, it seems.</p>

<p>"It's Miss Ellery, of Portland. Haven't you heard of
her?" he said, with an air of importance. "She's the great
beauty of Portland. They call her the 'little divinity.'
Met her last summer, at Mount Desert," he added, with
the comfortable air of a man in possession of the leading
fact of the hour&mdash;the fact about which everybody else is
inquiring.</p>

<p>I walked home behind her in a kind of trance, disdaining
to join in what I thought the very flippant and unworthy
comments of the boys. I saw the last wave of her white
garments as she passed between the two evergreens in
front of deacon Brown's square white house, which at that
moment became to me a mysterious and glorified shrine;
there the angel held her tabernacle.</p>

<p>At this moment I met Miss Dotha Brown, the deacon's
eldest daughter, a rosy-cheeked, pleasant-faced girl, to
whom I had been introduced the week before. Instantly
she was clothed upon with a new interest in my eyes, and
I saluted her with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empressement</i>; if not the rose, she at
least was the clay that was imbibing the perfume of the
rose; and I don't doubt that my delight at seeing her assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the appearance of personal admiration. "What a
charming Sunday," I said, with emphasis. "Perfectly charming,"
said Miss Brown, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"You have an interesting young friend staying with you,
I observe," said I.</p>

<p>"Who, Miss Ellery? oh, yes. Oh! Mr. Henderson, she
is the sweetest girl!" said Dotha, with effusion.</p>

<p>I didn't doubt it, and listened eagerly to her praises, and
was grateful to Miss Brown for the warm invitation to
"call" which followed. Miss Ellery was to make them a
long visit, and she would be <em>so</em> happy to introduce me.</p>

<p>That evening Miss Ellery was a topic of excited discussion
in our entry, and Jim Fellows plumed himself largely
on his Mount Desert experiences, which he related in a
way to produce the impression that he had been regarded
with a favorable eye by the divinity.</p>

<p>I was in a state of silent indignation, at him, at all the
rest of the boys, at everybody in general, being fully persuaded
that they were utterly incapable of understanding
or appreciating this wonderful creature.</p>

<p>"Hal, why don't you talk?" said one of them to me, when
I had sat silent, pretending to read for a long time; "What
do you think of her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm no ladies' man, as you all know," I said, evasively,
and actually pretended not to have remarked Miss
Ellery except in a cursory manner.</p>

<p>Then followed a period of weeks and months, when that
one image was never for a moment out of my thoughts.
By a strange law of our being, a certain idea can accompany
us everywhere, not stopping or interrupting the course
of the thought, but going on in a sort of shadowy way with
it, as an invisible presence.</p>

<p>The man or woman who cherishes an ideal is always
liable to this accident, that the spiritual image often descends
like a mantle, and invests some very ordinary person,
who is, for the time being, transfigured,&mdash;"a woman
clothed with the sun, and with the moon under her feet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
It is not what there is in the person, but what there is in
<em>us</em>, that gives this passage in life its critical power. It would
seem as if there were in some men, and some women,
preparation for a grand interior illumination and passion,
like that hoard of mystical gums and spices which the
phenix was fabled to prepare for its funeral pile; all the
aspiration and poetry and romance, the upheaval toward an
infinite and eternal good, a divine purity and rest, may be
enkindled by the touch of a very ordinary and earthly
hand, and, burning itself out, leave only cold ashes of experience.</p>

<p>Miss Ellery was a well-bred young lady, of decorous and
proper demeanor, of careful religious education, of no particular
strength either of mind or emotion, good tempered,
and with an instinctive approbativeness that made her
desirous to please every body, which created for her the
reputation that Miss Brown expressed in calling her "a
sweet girl." She was always most agreeable to those with
whom she was thrown, and for the time being appeared
to be, and was sincerely interested in them; but her mind
was like a well-polished looking-glass, retaining not a
trace of anything absent or distant.</p>

<p>She was gifted by nature with wonderful beauty, and
beauty of that peculiar style that stirs the senses of the
poetical and the ideal; her gentle approbativeness, and
the graceful facility of her manner, were such as not at
least to destroy the visions which her beauty created. In a
quiet way she enjoyed being adored&mdash;made love to, but she
never overstepped the bounds of strict propriety. She received
me with graciousness, and I really think found something
in my society which was agreeably stimulating to
her. I was somewhat out of the common track of her
adorers; my ardor and enthusiasm gave her a new emotion.
I wrote poems to her, which she read with a graceful pensiveness
and laid away among her trophies in her private
writing-desk. I called her my star, my inspiration, my
light, and she beamed down on me with a pensive purity.
"Yes, she was delighted to have me read Tennyson to her,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and many an hour when I should have been studying, I
was lounging in the little front parlor of the Brown house,
fancying myself Sir Galahad, and reading with emotion,
how his "blade was strong, because his heart was pure;"
and Miss Ellery murmured "How lovely!" and I was in
paradise.</p>

<p>And then there came wonderful moonlight evenings&mdash;evenings
when every leaf stirring had a penciled reproduction
flickering in light and shade on the turf; and we
walked together under arches of elm trees, and I talked and
quoted poetry; and she listened and assented in the sweetest
manner possible. All my hopes, my plans, my dreams,
my speculations, my philosophies, came out to sun themselves
under the magic of those lustrous eyes. Her replies
and utterances were greatly in disproportion to mine; but
I received them, and made much of them, as of old the
priests of Delphi did with those of the inspired maiden.
There must be deep meaning in it all, because she was a
priestess; and I was not backward to supply it.</p>

<p>I have often endeavored to analyze the sources of the
illusion cast over men by such characters as that of Miss
Ellery. In their case the instinctive action of approbativeness
assumes the semblance of human sympathy, and brings
them for the time being into the life-sphere, and under the
influence, of any person whom they wish to please, so that
they with a temporary sincerity reflect back the ideas and
feelings of others. There is just the same illusive sort of
charm in this reflection of our own thoughts and emotions
from another mind, as there is in the reflection of objects in
a placid lake. There is no warmth and no reality to it;
and yet, for the time being, it is often the most entrancing
thing in the world, and gives back to you the glow of your
own heart, the fervor of your imagination, and even every
little flower of fancy, and twig of feeling, with a wonderful
faithfulness of reproduction.</p>

<p>It is not real sympathy, because, like the image in the
lake, it is only there when you are present; and when you
are away, reflects with equal facility the next comer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>But men always have been, and to the end of time always
will be, fascinated by such women, and will suppose
this mere reflecting power of a highly polished surface to
be the sympathetic response for which the heart longs.</p>

<p>So I had no doubt that Miss Ellery was a woman of all
sorts of high literary tastes and moral heroisms, for there
was nothing so high or so deep in the aspirations of poets or
sages in my readings to her, that could not be reflected
and glorified in those wonderful eyes.</p>

<p>Neither are such women hypocrites, as they are often
called. What they give back to you is for the time being
a sincere reflection, and if there is no depth to it, if it
passes away with the passing hour, it is simply because
their natures&mdash;smooth, shallow, and cold&mdash;have no deeper
power of retention.</p>

<p>The fault lies in expecting more of a thing than there is
in its nature&mdash;a fault we shall more or less all go on committing
till the great curtain falls.</p>

<p>I wrote all about her to my mother; and received the usual
cautionary maternal epistle, reminding me that I was yet
far from that goal in life when I was warranted in asking
any woman to be my wife; and suggesting that my taste
might later with maturity; warning me against premature
commitments&mdash;in short, saying all that good, anxious
mothers usually say to young juniors in college in similar
circumstances.</p>

<p>In reply, I told my mother that I had found a woman
worthy the devotion of a life&mdash;a woman who would be inspiration
and motive and reward. I extolled her purity
and saintliness. I told my mother that she was forming
and leading me to all that was holy and noble. In short I
meant to win her though the seven labors of Hercules were
to be performed seven times over to reach her.</p>

<p>Now the fact is, my mother might have saved herself
her anxiety. Miss Ellery was perfectly willing to be my
guiding star, my inspiration, my light, within reasonable
limits, while making a visit in an otherwise rather dull town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
She liked to be read to; she liked the consciousness of
being incessantly admired, and would have made a very
good image for some Church of the Perpetual Adoration;
but after all, Miss Ellery was as incapable of forming an
ineligible engagement of marriage with a poor college
student, as the most sensible and collected of Walter Scott's
heroines.</p>

<p>Looking back upon this part of my life, I can pity myself
with as quiet and dispassionate a perception as if I were a
third person. The illusion, for the time being, was so real,
the feelings called up by it so honest and earnest and
sacred; and supposing there had been a tangible reality to
it&mdash;what might not such a woman have made of me, or of
any man?</p>

<p>And suppose it pleased God to send forth an army of such
women, as I thought her to be, among the lost children of
men, women armed not only with the outward and visible
sign of beauty, but with that inward and spiritual grace
which beauty typifies, one might believe that the golden age
would soon be back upon us.</p>

<p>Miss Ellery adroitly avoided all occasions of any critical
commitment on my part or on her's. Women soon learn a vast
amount of tact and diplomacy on that subject: but she gave
me to understand that I was peculiarly congenial to her, and
encouraged the outflow of all my romance with the gentlest
atmosphere of indulgence. To be sure, I was not the only
one whom she thus held with bonds of golden gossamer. She
reigned a queen, and had a court at her feet, and the
deacon's square, white, prosaic house bristled with the activity
and vivacity of Miss Ellery's adorers.</p>

<p>Among them. Will Marshall was especially distinguished.
Will was a senior, immensely rich, good-natured as the
longest summer day is long, but so idle and utterly incapable
of culture that only the liberality of the extra sum paid to
a professor who held him in guardianship secured his stay in
college classes. It has been my observation that money
will secure a great variety of things in this lower world, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
among others, will carry a very stupid fellow through college.</p>

<p>Will was a sort of favorite with us all. His good nature
was without limit, and he scattered his money with a free
hand, and so we generally spoke of him as "Poor Will;" a
nice fellow, if he couldn't write a decent note, and blundered
through all his recitations.</p>

<p>Will laid himself, so to speak, at Miss Ellery's feet. He
was flush of bouquets and confectionery. He caused the village
livery stable to import forthwith a turnout worthy to be
a car of Venus herself.</p>

<p>I saw all this, but it never entered my head that Miss
Ellery would cast a moment's thought other than those of
the gentlest womanly compassion on poor Will Marshall.</p>

<p>The time of the summer vacation drew nigh, and with the
close of the term closed the vision of my idyllic experiences
with Miss Ellery. To the last, she was so gentle and easy
to be entreated. Her lovely eyes cast on me such bright
encouraging glances; and she accorded me a farewell moonlight
ramble, wherein I walked not on earth, but in the
seventh heaven of felicity. Of course there was nothing
definite. I told her that I was a poor soldier of fortune, but
might I only wear her name in my bosom, it would be a
sacred talisman, and give strength to my arm, and she
sighed, and looked lovely, and she did not say me nay.</p>

<p>I went home to my mother, and wearied that much-enduring
woman, all through the vacation, with the hot and
cold fits of my fever. Blessed souls! these mothers, who
bear and watch and rear the restless creatures, who by
and by come to them with the very heart gone out of them
for love of another woman&mdash;some idle girl, perhaps, that
never knew what it was either to love or care, and that plays
with hearts as kittens do with pinballs!</p>

<p>I wrote to Miss Ellery letters long, overflowing, and got
back little neatly-worded notes on scented paper, speaking
in a general way of the charms of friendship.</p>

<p>But the first news that met me on my return to college
broke my soap-bubble at one touch.</p>

astonished when his basket of glass-ware fell in glittering
nothingness. I stood stupid with astonishment.</p>

<p>"<em>She</em> engaged to Will Marshall!&mdash;why, boys, he's a fool!"</p>

<p>"But you see he's rich. Oh, it's all arranged; they are to be
married next month, and go to Europe for their wedding
tour," said Jim Fellows.</p>

<p>And so my idol fell from its pedestal&mdash;and my first dream
dissolved.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="ph3">THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.</p>


<div>  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Miss</span>  Ellery was sufficiently mistress of herself,
and of circumstances, to close our little pastoral
in the most graceful and amiable manner possible.</p>

<p>I received a beautiful rose-scented note from her, saying
that the very kind interest in her happiness which I always
had expressed, and the extremely pleasant friendship
which had arisen between us, made her desirous of informing
me, &amp;c., &amp;c. Thereupon followed the announcement
of her engagement, terminating with the assurance that
whatever new ties she might form, or scenes she might visit,
she should ever cherish a pleasant remembrance of the
delightful hours spent beneath the elms of X., and indulge
the kindest wishes for my future success and happiness.</p>

<p>I, of course, crushed the rose-scented missive in my hand,
in the most approved tragical style, and felt that I had been
deceived, betrayed and undone. I passed forthwith into
that cynical state of young manhood, in which one learns
for the first time what a mere unimportant drop his own
most terribly earnest and excited feelings may be in the
tumbling ocean of the existing world.</p>

<p>This is a valley of humiliation, which lies, in very many
cases, just a day's walk beyond the palace, beautiful with
all its fascinations.</p>

<p>The moral geographer, John Bunyan, to whom we are
indebted for much wholesome information, tells us that
while it is extremely difficult to descend gracefully into this
valley, and pilgrims generally accomplish it at the expense
of many a sore trip and stumble, yet when once they
are fairly down, it presents many advantages of climate
and soil not other where found.</p>

<p>The shivering to pieces of the first ideal, while it breaks
ruthlessly and scatters much that is really and honestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
good and worthy, breaks up no less a certain stock of unconscious
self conceit, which young people are none the
worse for having lessened.</p>

<p>The very assumption, so common in the early days of
life, that we have feelings of a peculiar sacredness above
the comprehension of the common herd, and for which only
the selectest sympathy is possible, is one savoring a little
too much of the unregenerate natural man, to be safely
let alone to grow and thrive.</p>

<p>Natures, in particular, where ideality is largely in the
ascendant, are apt to begin life with the scheme of building
a high and thick stone wall of reticence around themselves,
and enthroning therein an idol, whose rites and service are
to be performed with a contemptuous indifference to all the
rest of mankind.</p>

<p>When this idol is suddenly disenchanted by some stroke
of inevitable reality, and we discern that the image which
we had supposed to be the shrine of a divinity, is only a
very earthly doll, stuffed with saw-dust, one's pinnacles and
battlements&mdash;the whole temple in short, that we have prided
ourselves on, comes tumbling down about us like the walls
of Jericho, not without a certain sense of the ridiculous.
Though, like other afflictions, this is not for the present
joyous, still the space thus cleared in our mind may be so
cultivated as afterwards to bring forth peaceable fruits of
righteousness.</p>

<p>In my case, my idol was utterly defaced and destroyed
in my eyes, because I could not conceal from myself that
she was making a marriage wholly without the one element
that above all others marriage requires.</p>

<p>Miss Ellery was perfectly well aware of the mental inferiority
of poor Bill Marshall, and had listened unreprovingly
to the half-contemptuous pity with which it was customary
among us to speak of him. I remembered how
patronizingly I had often talked of him to her, "Really
not a bad fellow&mdash;only a little weak, you see;" and the
pretty, graceful drollery in her eyes. I remembered things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that these same eyes had looked at me, when he blundered
and miscalled words in conversation, and a thousand sayings
and intimations, each by itself indefinite as the boundary
between two tints of the rainbow, by which she showed
a superior sense of pleasure in my conversation and society.</p>

<p>And was all this acting and insincerity? I thought not.
I was and am fully convinced that had I only been possessed
of the wealth of Bill Marshall, Miss Ellery would
infinitely have preferred me as a life companion; and it was
no very serious amount of youthful vanity to imagine that
I should have proved a more entertaining one. I can easily
imagine that she made the decision with some gentle regret
at first,&mdash;regret dried up like morning dew in the full
sunlight of wedding diamonds, and capable of being put
completely to sleep upon a couch of cashmere shawls.</p>

<p>With what indignant bitterness did I listen to all the
details of the impending wedding from fluent Jim Fellows,
who, being from Portland and well posted in all the
gossip of the circle in which she moved, enlightened our
entry with daily and weekly bulletins of the grandeur and
splendors that were being, and to be.</p>

<p>"Boys, only think! Her wedding present from him is a
set of diamonds valued at twenty-five thousand dollars.
Bob Rivers saw them on exhibition at Tiffany's. Then she
has three of the most splendid cashmere shawls that ever
were imported into Maine. Captain Sautelle got them from
an Indian Prince, and there's no saying what they would
have cost at usual rates. I tell you Bill is going it in style,
and they are going to be married with drums and trumpets,
cymbals and dances; such a wedding as will make old Portland
stare; and then off they are going to travel no end of
time in Europe, and see all the kingdoms of the world,
and the glory of them."</p>

<p>Now, I suppose none of us doubted that could Miss Ellery
have attained the diamonds and the cashmeres and the
fortune, with all its possibilities of luxury and self-indulgence,
without the addition of the husband, nothing would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
have been wanting to complete her good fortune; but it
is a condition in the way of a woman's making a fortune by
marriage, as it was with Faust's compact with an unmentionable
party, that it can only be ratified by the sacrifice
of herself&mdash;herself, and for life! A sacrifice most awful
and holy when made in pure love, and most fearful when
made for any other consideration. The fact that Miss
Ellery could make it was immediate and complete disenchantment
to me.</p>

<p>Mine is not, I suppose, the only case where the ideal
which has been formed under the brooding influence of a
noble mother is shattered by the hand of a woman. Some
woman, armed with the sacramental power of beauty, enkindles
the highest manliness of the youth, and is, in his
eyes, the incarnate form of purity and unworldly virtue, the
high prize and incitement to valor, patience, constancy and
courage, in the great life-battle.</p>

<p>But she sells herself before his eyes, for diamonds and
laces, and trinkets and perfumes; for the liberty of walking
on soft carpets and singing in gilded cages; and all the
world laughs at his simplicity in supposing that, a fair
chance given, any woman would ever do otherwise. Is not
beauty woman's capital in trade, the price put into her
hand to get whatever she needs; and are not the most
beautiful, as a matter of course, destined prizes of the
richest?</p>

<p>Miss Ellery's marriage was to me a great awakening, a
coming out of a life of pure ideas and sentiment into one
of external realities. Hitherto, I had lived only with people
all whose measures and valuations had been those relating
to the character&mdash;the intellect and the heart. Never in my
father's house had I heard the gaining of money spoken of
as success in life, except as far as money was needed to
advance education, and education was a means for doing
good. My father had his zeal, his earnestness, his exultations,
but they all related to things <em>to be done</em> in his life-work;
the saving of souls, the conversion of sinners, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
gathering of churches, the repression of intemperance and
immorality, the advancement of education. My elder brothers
had successfully entered the ministry under his influence,
and in counsels with them where to settle, I had never heard
the question of salary or worldly support even discussed.
The first, the only question I ever heard considered, was
<em>What work was needed to be done</em>, and what fitness for the
doing of it; taking for granted the record, that where the
Kingdom of God and its righteousness were first sought,
all things would be added.</p>

<p>Thus all my visions of future life had in them something
of the innocent verdancy of the golden age, when noble
men strove for the favor of fair women, by pureness, by
knowledge, by heroism,&mdash;and the bravest won the crown
from the hand of the most beautiful.</p>

<p>And suddenly to my awakened eyes the whole rushing
cavalcade of fashionable life swept by, bearing my princess,
amid waving feathers and flashing jewels and dazzling robes
and merry laughs and jests, leaving me by the way-side
dazed and covered with dust, to plod on alone.</p>

<p>Now first I felt the shame which comes over a young man,
that he has not known the world as old wordlings know it.</p>

<p>In the discussions among the boys, relating to this marriage,
I first learned the power of that temptation which
comes upon every young man to look on wealth as the first
object in a life race.</p>

<p>Woman is by order of nature the conservator of the ideal.
Formed of finer clay, with nicer perceptions, and refined
fiber, she is the appointed priestess to guard the poetry of
life from sacrilege; but if she be bribed to betray the
shrine, what hope for us? "If the salt have lost its savor,
wherewith shall it be salted?"</p>

<p>My acquaintance with Miss Ellery had brought me out of my scholastic
retirement, and made me an acquaintance of the whole bevy of the girls
of X. Miss Ellery had been invited and fêted in all the families, and
her special train of adorers had followed her, and thus I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au courant</i>" of all the existing
girl-world of our little town. It was curious to remark what a silken
flutter of wings, what an endless volubility of tongues there was, about
this engagement and marriage, and how, on the whole, it was treated as
the height of splendor and good fortune. My rosy-faced friend, Miss
Dotha, was invited to the festival as bridesmaid, and returned
thereafter "trailing clouds of glory" into the primitive circles of X;
and my cynical bitterness of soul took a sort of perverse pleasure in
the amplifications and discussions that I constantly heard in the
tea-drinking circles of the town.</p>

<p>"Oh, girls, you've no idea about those diamonds," said
Miss Dotha; "great big diamonds as large as peas, and just
as clear as water! Bill Marshall made them send orders
to Europe specially for the purpose; then she had a pearl
set that his mother gave, and his sister gave an amethyst
set for a breakfast suit! and you ought to have seen the
presents! It was a perfect bazar! The Marshalls are an
enormously rich family, and they all came down splendidly:
old uncle Tom Marshall gave a solid silver dining set
embossed with gold, and old Aunt Tabitha Marshall gave
a real Sévres china tea-set, that was taken out of one of
the royal palaces in France, at the time of the French
Revolution. Captain Atkins was in France about the time
they were sacking palaces, and doing all such things, and he
brought away quite a number of things that found their
way into some of these rich old Portland families. Her
wedding veil was given by old Grandmamma Marshall, and
was said to have been one that belonged to Queen Marie
Antoinette, taken by some of those horrid women when they
sacked the Tuilleries, and sold to Captain Atkins; at any
rate, it was the most wonderful point lace, just like an old
picture."</p>

<p>Fancy the drawing of breaths, the exclamations, the groans
of delight, from a knot of pretty, well-dressed, nice country
girls, at these wonderful glimpses into Paradise.</p>

<p>"After all," I said, "I think this custom of loading down a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
woman with finery just at her marriage hour, is giving it
when she is least able to appreciate it. Why distract her
with gew-gaws at the very moment when her heart must
be so full of a new affection that she cares for nothing else?
Miss Ellery is probably so lost in her love for Mr. Marshall,
that she scarcely gives a thought to these things, and really
forgets that she has them. It would be much more in point
to give them to some girl that hasn't a lover."</p>

<p>I spoke with a simple, serious air, as if I had most perfect
faith in my words, and a general gentle smile of amusement
went round the circle, rippling into a laugh out-right,
on the faces of some of the gayer girls. Miss Dotha said:</p>

<p>"Oh, come, now, Mr. Henderson, you are too severe."</p>

<p>"Severe!" said I; "I can't understand what you mean,
Miss Dotha. You don't mean, of course, to intimate that
Miss Ellery is <em>not</em> in love with the man she has married?"</p>

<p>"Oh, now!" said Miss Dotha, laughing, "you know perfectly,
Mr. Henderson&mdash;we all know&mdash;it's pretty well understood,
that this wasn't <em>exactly</em> what you call a love-match;
in fact, I know," she added with the assurance of
a confidant, "that she had great difficulty in <em>making up
her mind</em>; but her family were very anxious for the match,
and his family thought it would be such a good thing for
him to marry and settle down, you know, so one way and
another she concluded to take him."</p>

<p>"And, after all, Will Marshall is a good-natured creature,"
said Miss Smith.</p>

<p>"And going to Europe is such a temptation," said Miss
Brown.</p>

<p>"And she must marry some time," said Miss Jones, "and
one can't have <em>every</em> thing, you know. Will is certain to be
kind to her, and let her have her own way."</p>

<p>"For my part," said pretty Miss Green, "I'm free to say
that I don't blame any girl that has a chance to get such
a fortune, for doing it as Miss Ellery has. I've always been
poor, and pinched and plagued; never can go any where,
or see anything, or dress as I want to; and if I had a chance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
such as Miss Ellery had, I think I should be a fool not to
take it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Miss Black, reflectively, "the only question
is, couldn't Miss Ellery have waited and found a man who
had more intellect, and more culture, whom she could respect
and love, and who had money, too? She had such
extraordinary beauty and such popular manners, I should
have thought she might."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Miss Dotha, "she was getting on&mdash;she
was three-and-twenty already&mdash;and nobody of just the right
sort had turned up&mdash;'a bird in the hand'&mdash;you know. After
all, I dare say she can love Will Marshall well enough."</p>

<p><em>Well enough!</em> The cool philosophic tone of this phrase
smote on my ear curiously.</p>

<p>"And pray, fair ladies, how much is 'well enough?'"
said I.</p>

<p>"Well enough to keep the peace," said Miss Green, "and
each let the other alone, to go their own ways and have no
fighting."</p>

<p>Miss Green was a pretty, spicy little body, with a pair of
provoking hazel eyes; who talked like an unprincipled
little pirate, though she generally acted like a nice woman.
In less than a year after, by the by, she married a home
missionary, in Maine, and has been a devoted wife and
mother in a little parish somewhere in the region of Skowhegan,
ever since.</p>

<p>But I returned to my room gloriously misanthropic, and
for some time my thoughts, like bees, were busy gathering
bitter honey. I gave up visiting in the tea-drinking circles
of X. I got myself a dark sombrero hat, which I slouched
down over my eyes in bandit style when I walked the street
and met with any of my former gentle acquaintances. I
wrote my mother most sublime and awful letters on the
inconceivable vanity and nothingness of human life. I
read Plato and Æschylus, and Emerson's Essays, and
began to think myself an old Philosopher risen from the
dead. There was a melancholy gravity about all my college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
exercises, and I began to look down on young freshmen
and sophomores with a serene compassion, as a sage who has
passed through the vale of years and learned that all is
vanity.</p>

<p>The valley of humiliation may have its charms&mdash;it is said
that there are many flowers that grow there, and nowhere
else, but for all that, a young fellow, so far as I know,
generally walks through the first part of it in rather a surly
and unamiable state.</p>

<p>To be sure, had I been wise, I should have been ready to
return thanks on my knees for my disappointment. True,
the doll was stuffed with saw-dust, but it was not <em>my</em>
doll. I had not learned the cheat when it was forever too
late to help myself, and was not condemned to spend life in
vain attempts to make a warm, living friend of a cold
marble statue. Many a man has succeeded in getting his
first ideal, and been a miserable man always thereafter, and
therefore.</p>

<p>I have lived to hear very tranquilly of Mrs. Will Marshall's
soirées and parties, as she reigns in the aristocratic circles
of New York; and to see her, still like a polished looking-glass,
gracefully reflecting every one's whims and tastes
and opinions with charming suavity, and forgetting them
when their backs are turned; and to think that she is the
right thing in the right place&mdash;a crowned Queen of Vanity
Fair.</p>

<p>I have become, too, very tolerant and indulgent to the
women who do as she did,&mdash;use their own charms as the
coin wherewith to buy the riches and honors of the world.</p>

<p>The world has been busy for some centuries in shutting
and locking every door through which a woman could step
into wealth, except the door of marriage. All vigor and
energy, such as men put forth to get this golden key of life,
is condemned and scouted as unfeminine; and a woman
belonging to the upper classes, who undertakes to get
wealth by honest exertion and independent industry, loses
caste, and is condemned by a thousand voices as an oddity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and a deranged person. A woman gifted with beauty, who
sells it to buy wealth, is far more leniently handled. That
way of getting money is not called unwomanly; and so long
as the whole force of the world goes that way, such marriages
as Miss Ellery's and Bill Marshall's will be considered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
régle</i>.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE BLUE MISTS.</p>


<div>  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My</span> college course was at last finished satisfactorily
to my mother and friends. What joy there is to
be got in college honors was mine. I studied
faithfully and graduated with the valedictory.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I came back home again a sadder if not a
wiser man than I went. In fact a tendency to fits of despondency
and dejection had been growing upon me in these
last two years of my college life.</p>

<p>With all the self-confidence and conceit that is usually
attributed to young men, and of which they have their
share undoubtedly, they still have their times of walking
through troubled waters, and sinking in deep mire where
there is no standing.</p>

<p>During my last year, the question "What are you good
for?" had often borne down like a nightmare upon me.
When I entered college all was distant, golden, indefinite,
and I was sure that I was good for almost anything that
could be named. Nothing that ever had been attained by
man looked to me impossible. Riches, honor, fame, any
thing that any other man unassisted had wrought out for
himself with his own right arm, I could work out also.</p>

<p>But as I measured myself with real tasks, and as I rubbed
and grated against other minds and whirled round and
round in the various experiences of college life, I grew
smaller and smaller in my own esteem, and oftener and
oftener in my lonely hours it seemed as if some evil genius
delighted to lord it over me and sitting at my bed-side or
fire-side to say "What are you good for, to what purpose
all the pains and money that have been thrown away on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
you? You'll never be anything; you'll only mortify your
poor mother that has set her heart on you, and make
your Uncle Jacob ashamed of you." Can any anguish
equal the depths of those blues in which a man's whole
self hangs in suspense before his own eyes, and he doubts
whether he himself, with his entire outfit and apparatus,
body, soul, and spirit, isn't to be, after all, a complete
failure? Better, he thinks never to have been born, than to
be born to no purpose. Then first he wrestles with the
question, What is life for, and what am I to do or seek
in it? It seems to be not without purpose, that the active
life-work of the great representative Man of Men was
ushered in by a forty days dreary wandering in the wilderness
hungry, faint, and tempted of the Devil; for certainly,
after education has pretty thoroughly waked up all there
is in a man, and the time is at hand that he is to make
the decision what to do with it, there often comes a wandering,
darkened, unsettled, tempted passage in his life. In
Christ's temptations we may see all that besets the young
man.</p>

<p>The daily bread question, or how to get a living,&mdash;the
ambitious heavings, or the kingdoms of the world and the
glory of them, all to be got by some yielding to Satan,&mdash;the
ostentatious impulse to come down on the world with a rush
and a sensation,&mdash;these are mirrored in a young man's smaller
life just as they were in that great life. The whole Heavens
can be reflected in the little pool as in the broad ocean!</p>

<p>All these elements of unrest had been boiling in my mind
during the last year. Who wants to be nothing in the great
world? No <em>young</em> man at this time of his course. The wisdom
of becoming nothing that he may possess all things is
too high for this stage of immaturity.</p>

<p>I came into college as simple, and contented, and satisfied,
as a huckleberry bush in a sweet-fern pasture. I felt
rich enough for all I wanted to do, and my path of life lay
before me defined with great simplicity.</p>

<p>But my intimacy with Miss Ellery, her marriage and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
that pertained to it, had brought before my eyes the world
of wealth and fashion, a world which a young collegian
may try to despise, and about which he may write the most
disparaging moral reflections, but which has, after all, its
power to trouble his soul. The consciousness of being gloveless,
and threadbare in toilet, comes over one in certain
atmospheres, as the consciousness of nakedness to Adam
and Eve. It is true that in the institution where I attended,
as in many other rural colleges in New England, I was backed
up by a majority of healthy-minded, hardy men, of real
mark and worth, children of honest toil and self-respecting
poverty, who were bravely working their way up through
education to the prizes and attainments of life. Simple
economies were therefore well understood and respected in
the college.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there is something not altogether vulgar in
the attractions which wealth enables one to throw around
himself. I was a social favorite in college, and took a stand
among my fellows as a writer and speaker, and so had a
considerable share of that sincere sort of flattery which college
boys lavish on each other. I was invited and made
much of by some whose means were ample, whose apartments
were luxuriously and tastefully furnished, but who
were none the less good scholars and high-minded gentlemanly
fellows.</p>

<p>In their vacations I had been invited to their houses, and
had seen all the refinement, the repose, the ease and the quietude
that comes from the possession of wealth in the hands of
those who know how to use it. Wealth in such hands gives
opportunities of the broadest culture, ability to live in the
wisest manner, freedom to choose the healthiest surroundings
both for mind and body, not restricted by considerations
of expense; and how could I think it anything else than
an object ardently to be sought?</p>

<p>It is true, my rich friends seemed equally to enjoy the vacations
in my little, plain, mountain home. People generally
are insensible to advantages they have always enjoyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and have an appetite for something new; so the homely rusticity
of our house, the perfect freedom from conventionalities,
the wild, mountain scenery, the wholesome detail of
farm life, the barn with its sweet stores of hay, and its
nooks and corners and hiding places, the gathering in of
our apples, and the making of cider, the corn-huskings and
Thanksgiving frolics, seemed to have their interest and
delights to them, and they often told me I was a lucky fellow
to be born to such pleasant surroundings. But I thought
within myself, It is easy to say this when you feel the control
of thousands in your pocket, when if you are tired you can
go to any land or country of the earth for change of scene.</p>

<p>In fact we see in history that the crusade of St. Francis in
favor of Poverty was not begun by a poor man, but by a
young nobleman who had known nothing hitherto but
wealth and luxury. It is from the rich, if from any, that our
grasping age must learn renunciation and simplicity. It
is easier to renounce a good which one has tried and of which
one knows all the attendant thorns and stings than to renounce
one that has been only painted by the imagination,
and whose want has been keenly felt. When I came
to the College I came from the controlling power of home
influences. At an early age I had felt the strength of that
sphere of spirituality that encircled the lives of my parents,
and, being very receptive and sympathetic, had reflected in
my childish nature all their feelings.</p>

<p>I had renounced the world before I knew what the world
was. I had joined my father's church and was looked upon
as one destined in time to take up my father's work of the
ministry.</p>

<p>Four years had passed and I came back to my mother,
weakened and doubting, indisposed to take up the holy
work to which in my early days I looked forward with enthusiasm,
yet with all the sadness which comes from indecision
as to one's life-object.</p>

<p>To be a minister is to embrace a life of poverty, of toil, of
self-denial. To do this, not only with cheerfulness but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
an enthusiasm which shall bear down all before it, which
shall elevate it into the region of moral poetry and ideality,
requires a fervid, unshaken faith. The man must feel the
power of an endless life, be lifted above things material
and temporal to things sublime and eternal.</p>

<p>Now it is one peculiarity of the professors of the Christian
religion that they have not, at least of late years, arranged
their system of education with any wise adaptation to having
their young men come out of it <em>Christians</em>. In this they
differ from many other religionists. The Brahmins educate
their sons so that they shall infallibly become Brahmins;
the Jews so that they shall infallibly be Jews; the Mohammedans
so that they shall be Mohammedans; but the Christians
educate their sons so that nearly half of them turn out
unbelievers&mdash;professors of no religion at all.</p>

<p>There is a book which the Christian world unite in declaring
to be an infallible revelation from Heaven. It has
been the judgment of critics that the various writings in
this volume excel other writings in point of mere literary
merit as much as they do in purity and elevation of the
moral sentiment. Yet it is remarkable that the critical
study of these sacred writings in their original tongues
is not in most of our Christian colleges considered as an
essential part of the education of a Christian gentleman,
while the heathen literature of Greece and Rome is treated
as something indispensable, and to be gained at all hazards.</p>

<p>It is a fact that from the time that the boy begins to fit
for college, his mind is so driven and pressed with the effort
to acquire the classical literature, that there is no time to
acquire the literature of the Bible, neither is it associated
in his mind with the dignity and respect of a classical
attainment. He <em>must</em> be familiar with Horace and Ovid,
with Cicero and Plato, Æschylus and Homer in their original
tongues, but the majestic poetry of the Old Testament, and
its sages and seers and prophets, become with every advancing
year more unintelligible to him. A thoroughly educated
graduate of most of our colleges is unprepared to read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
intelligently many parts of Isaiah or Ezekiel or Paul's epistles.
The scripture lessons of the church service often
strike on his ear as a strange quaint babble of peculiar
sounds, without rhyme or reason. Uncultured and uneducated
in all that should enable him to understand them, he
is only preserved by a sort of educational awe from regarding
them as the jargon of barbarians.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this literature of the Bible, strange, weird,
sibylline, and full of unfulfilled needs and requirements of
study, is being assailed in detail through all the courses of a
boy's college life. The objections to it as a divine revelation
relate to critical questions in languages of which he is
ignorant, and yet they are everywhere; they are in the
air he breathes, they permeate all literature, they enter
into modern science, they disintegrate and wear away, bit
by bit, his reverence and his confidence.</p>

<p>This work had been going on insensibly in my head during
my college life, notwithstanding the loyalty of my
heart. During those years I had learned to associate the
Bible with the most sacred memories of home, with the
dearest loves of home life. It was woven with remembrances
of daily gatherings around the family altar, with
scenes of deepest emotion when I had seen my father and
mother fly to its shelter and rest upon its promises. There
were passages that never recurred to me except with the
sound of my father's vibrating voice, penetrating their
words with a never dying power. The Bible was to me
like a father and a mother, and the doubts, and queries,
the respectful suggestions of incredulity, the mildly suggestive
abatements of its authority, which met me, now here
and now there, in all the course of my readings and studies,
were as painful to me as reflections cast on my father's
probity or my mother's honor.</p>

<p>I would not listen to them, I would not give them
voice, I smothered them in the deepest recesses of my
heart, while meantime the daily pressure that came on me
in the studies and requirements of college life left me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
neither leisure nor inclination to pursue the researches that
should clear them up.</p>

<p>To be sure, nothing is so important as the soul&mdash;nothing is
of so much moment as religion, and the question "Is this
God's book or is it not?" is the question of questions. It
underlies all things, and he who is wise would drop all other
things and undergo any toil and make any studies that should
fit him to judge understandingly on this point. But I speak
from experience when I say that the course of study in
christian America is so arranged that a boy, from the grammar
school upward till he graduates, is so fully pressed and
overladen with all other studies that there is no probability
that he will find the time or the inclination for such investigation.</p>

<p>In most cases he will do just what I did, throw himself
upon the studies proposed to him, work enough to meet
the demands of the hour, and put off the acquisition of that
more important knowledge to an indefinite future, and sigh,
and go backward in his faith.</p>

<p>But without faith or with a faith trembling and uncertain,
how is a man to turn his back on the world that is before
him&mdash;the world that he can see, hear, touch and taste&mdash;to
work for the world that is unseen and eternal?</p>

<p>I will not repeat the flattering words that often fell on my
ear and said to me, "You can make your way anywhere;
you can be anything you please." And then there were
voices that said in my heart, "I may have wealth, and with it
means of power, of culture, of taste, of luxury. If I only set
out for that, I may get it." And then, in contrast, came that
life I had seen my father live, in its grand simplicity, in
its enthusiastic sincerity, in its exulting sense of joy in what
he was doing, down to the last mortal moment, and I wished,
oh, how fervently! that I could believe as he did. But
to be a minister merely from a sense of duty&mdash;to bear the
burden of poverty with no perception of the unspeakable
riches which Christ hath placed therein&mdash;who would not
shrink from a life so grating and so cold? To choose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ministry as a pedestal for oratory and self-display and poetic
religious sentiment, and thus to attain distinction and easy
position, and the command of fashionable luxury, seemed
to me a temptation to desecration still more terrible, and
I dreaded the hour which should close my college life and
make a decision inevitable.</p>

<p>It was with a sober and sad heart that I closed my college
course and parted from class-mates&mdash;jolly fellows with
whom had rolled away the four best years of my life&mdash;years
that as one goes on afterwards in age look brighter and
brighter in the distance. It was a lonesome and pokerish
operation to dismantle the room that had long been my
home, to bargain away my furniture, pack my books,
and bid a final farewell to all the old quiddities and oddities
that I had grown attached to in the quaint little village.
The parting from Alma Mater is a second leaving of
home&mdash;and this time for the great world. There is no staving
off the battle of life now&mdash;the tents are struck, the
camp-fires put out, and one must be on the march.</p>

<p class="ph3">AN OUTLOOK INTO LIFE.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My</span> coming back to my native town was an event of
public notoriety. I had won laurels, and as I was
the village property, my laurels were duly commented
on and properly appreciated. Highland was one of
those thrifty Yankee settlements where every house seems to
speak the people so well-to-do, and so careful, and progressive
in all the means of material comfort. There was not a
house in it that was not in a sort of healthy, growing state,
receiving, from time to time, some accession that showed
that the Yankee aspiration was busy, stretching and enlarging.
This had a new bay-window, and that had a new
veranda; the other, new, tight, white picket fences all round
the yard. Others rejoiced in a fresh coat of paint. But all
were alive, and apparently self-repairing. There was to
every house the thrifty wood-pile, seasoning for winter;
the clean garden, with its wealth of fruit and its gay borders
of flowers; and every new kind of flower, and every
choice new fruit, found somewhere a patron who was trying
a hand at it.</p>

<p>Highland was a place worth living in just for its scenery.
It was at that precise point of the country where the hills
are inspiriting, vivacious, reminding one of the Psalm,&mdash;"The
little hills rejoice on every side!" Mountains are
grand, but they also are dreary. For a near prospect they
overpower too much, they shut out the sun, they have savage
propensities, untamable by man, shown once in a while
in land-slides and freshets; but these half-grown hills uplift
one like waves of the sea. In summer they are wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in all possible shades of greenness; in autumn they are like
a mystical rainbow&mdash;an ocean of waves, flamboyant with
every wonderful device of color; and even when the leaves
are gone, in November, and nothing left but the bristling
steel-blue outlines of trees, there is a wonderful purple
haze, a veil of dreamy softness, around them, that makes
you think you never saw them so beautiful.</p>

<p>So I said to myself, as I came rambling over hill and dale
back to the old homestead, and met my mother's bright
face of welcome at the door. I was the hero of the hour
at home, and everything had been prepared to make me
welcome. My brother, who kept the homestead, had relinquished
the prospect of a college life, and devoted himself
to farming, but looked on me as the most favored of mortals
in the attainments I had made. His young wife and
growing family of children clustered around my mother
and leaned on her experience; and as every one in the little
village knew and loved her, there was a general felicitation
and congratulation on the event of my return and my
honors.</p>

<p>"See him in his father's pulpit afore long," said Deacon
Manning, who called the first evening to pay his respects;
"better try his hand at the weekly prayer meeting, and stir
us up a bit."</p>

<p>"I think, Deacon," said I, "I shall have to be one of
those that learn in silence, awhile longer. I may come to
be taught, but I certainly cannot teach."</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's modest for a young fellow that's just
been through college! They commonly are as feathery and
highflying as a this year's rooster, and ready to crow
whether their voice breaks or not," said the deacon.
"'Learn in silence!' Well, that 'ere beats all for a young
man!"</p>

<p>I thought to myself that the good deacon little knew the
lack of faith that was covered by my humility.</p>

<p>Since my father's death, my mother had made her home
with my Uncle Jacob, her health was delicate, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
preferred to enjoy the honors of a grandmother at a little
distance. My Uncle Jacob had no children. Aunt Polly,
his wife, was just the softest, sleekest, most domestic dove
of a woman whose wings were ever covered with silver. I
always think of her in some soft, pearly silk, with a filmy
cap, and a half-handkerchief crossed over a gentle, motherly
bosom, soft moving, soft speaking, but with a pair of
bright, hazel eyes, keen as arrows to send their glances into
every place in her dominions. Let anybody try sending in
a false account to Aunt Polly, and they will see that the
brightness of her eyes was not merely for ornament. Yet
everything she put her hand to went so exactly, so easily,
you would have said those eyes were made for nothing but
reading, for which Aunt Polly had a great taste, and for
which she found abundance of leisure.</p>

<p>My mother and she were enjoying together a long and
quiet Saturday afternoon of life, reading to each other, and
quietly and leisurely discussing all that they read,&mdash;not
merely the last novel, as the fashion of women in towns
and cities is apt to be, but all the solid works of philosophy
and literature that marked the times. My uncle's house was
like a bookseller's stall,&mdash;it was overrunning with books.
The cases covered the walls; they crowded the corners
and angles; and still every noteworthy book was ordered,
to swell the stock.</p>

<p>My mother and aunt had read together Lecky, and
Buckle, and Herbert Spencer, with the keen critical interest
of fresh minds. Had it troubled their faith? Not
in the least; no more than it would that of Mary on the
morning after the resurrection! There is a certain moral
altitude where faith becomes knowledge, and the bat-wings
of doubt cannot fly so high. My mother was
dwelling in that land of Beulah, where the sun always
shineth, and the bells of the heavenly city are heard, and
the shining ones walk. All was clear to her, all bright,
all real, in "the beyond;" but that kind of evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
is above the realm of heavy-footed reason. The "joy unspeakable,"
the "peace that passeth understanding," are
things that cannot be passed from hand to hand. Else I
am quite sure my mother would have taken the crown of
joy from her head and the peace from her bosom, and
given them to me. But the "white stone with the new
name" is Christ's gift to each for himself, and "no man
knoweth it save he that receiveth it."</p>

<p>But these witnesses who stand gazing into heaven are
not without their power on us who stand lower. It steadied
my moral nerves, so to speak, that my mother had read
and weighed the words that were making so much doubt
and shaking; that she fully comprehended them, and that
she smiled without fear.</p>

<p>She listened without distress, without anxiety, to all my
doubts and falterings. "You must pass through this; you
will be led; it will all come right," she said; "and then
perhaps you will be the guide of others."</p>

<p>I had feared to tell her that I had abandoned the purpose
of the ministry, but I found it easy.</p>

<p>"I would not have you embrace the ministry for anything
but a true love," she said, "any more than I would that
you should marry a wife for any other reason. If ever
the time comes that you feel you <em>must</em> be that, it will be
your call; but you can be God's minister otherwise than
through the pulpit."</p>

<p>"Talk over your plans with your uncle," she said; "he
is in your father's place now."</p>

<p>In fact, my uncle, having no children of his own, had
set his heart on me, and was disposed to make me heir, not
only to his very modest personal estate, but also to his
harvest of ideas and opinions,&mdash;all that backwater of
thoughts and ideas that accumulate on the mind of a man
who thinks and reads a great deal in a lonely neighborhood.
So he took me up as a companion in his daily rides
over the country.</p>

<p>"Well, Harry, where next?" he said to me the day after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
my return, as we were driving together. "What are you
about? Going to try the ministry?"</p>

<p>"I dare not; I am not fit. I know father wanted it, and
prayed for it, and nothing would be such a joy to mother,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>My uncle gave a shrewd, sidelong glance on me.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are like a good many fellows; an education
gives them a general shaking up, and all their beliefs
break from their lashings and go rolling and tumbling
about like spars and oil-casks in a storm on ship-board."</p>

<p>"I can't say that is true of all my beliefs; but yet a great
many things that I tried to regard as certain are untied. I
have too many doubts for a teacher."</p>

<p>"Who hasn't? I don't know anything in heaven or
earth that forty unanswerable questions can't be asked
about."</p>

<p>"You know," answered I, "Tennyson says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">'There lives more faith in honest doubt,</div>
      <div class="verse">Believe me, than in half the creeds.'"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"H'm! that depends. Doubt is very well as a sort of
constitutional crisis in the beginning of one's life; but if
it runs on and gets to be chronic, it breaks a fellow up, and
makes him morally spindling and sickly. Men that <em>do</em> anything
in the world must be men of strong convictions; it
won't do to go through life like a hen, craw-crawing and
lifting up one foot, and not knowing where to set it down
next."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "while I am passing through the constitutional
crisis, as you call it, is the very time I must make up
my mind to teach others on the most awful of all subjects.
I cannot and dare not. I must be a learner for some years
to come, and I must be a learner without any pledges,
expressed or implied, to find the truth this way or that."

"Well," said my uncle; "I'm not so greatly concerned
about that&mdash;the Lord needs other ministers besides those in
the pulpit. Why, man, the sermons on the evidences of
Christianity that have come home to me most have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
preached by lay preachers in poor houses and lonely
churches, by ignorant men and women, and little children."
"There's old Aunt Sarah there," he said, pointing with his
whip to a brown house in the distance, "that woman is
dying of a cancer, that slowly eats away her life in lingering
agony, and all her dependence is the work of a sickly,
consumptive daughter, and yet she is more than resigned to
her lot, she is so cheerful, so thankful, so hopeful, there is
such a blessed calm peace, and rest, and sweetness in that
house, that I love to go there. The influence of that
woman is felt all through the village&mdash;<em>she</em> preaches to some
purpose."</p>

<p>"Because she <em>knows</em> what she believes," I said.</p>

<p>"It was the same with your father, Harry. Now my
boy," he added, turning to me with the old controversial
twinkle in his eye, and speaking in a confidential tone&mdash;"The
fact is, I never agreed with your father doctrinally,
there were weak spots in his system all along, and I always
told him so. I could trip him and floor him in an argument,
and have done it a hundred times," he said, giving a touch
to his horse.</p>

<p>I thought to myself that it was well enough that my
father wasn't there to hear that statement, otherwise there
would have been an immediate tilting match, and the
whole ground to be gone over.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "it wasn't mainly in your father's
theology that his strength lay&mdash;it was the Christ in him&mdash;the
great warm heart&mdash;his crystal purity and simplicity&mdash;his
unworldly earnestness and honesty. He was a godly
man and a manly man both, and he sowed seed all over
this State that came up good men and good women. Yes,
there are hundreds and hundreds in this State to-day that
are good men and good women, mainly because he lived.
<em>That's</em> what I call success in life, Harry, when a man carries
himself so that he turns into seed-corn and makes a harvest
of good people. You may upset a man's reasonings, and
his theology may go to the dogs, but a brave Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
life you can't upset, it will tell. Now, Harry, are you going
to try for that?"</p>

<p>"God helping me, I will," I said.</p>

<p>"You see, as to the theologies," he added, "I think it has
been well said that the Christian world just now is like
a ship that's tacking, it has lost the wind on one side and
not quite got it on the other. The growth of society, the
development of new physical laws, and this modern scientific
rush of the human mind is going to modify the man-made
theologies and creeds; some of them will drop away
just as the blossom does when the fruit forms, but Christ's
religion will be just the same as ever&mdash;his words will not
pass away."</p>

<p>"But then," I said "there are a whole labyrinth of perplexing
questions about this Bible. What is inspiration?
What ground does it cover? How much of all these books
is inspired? What is their history? How came we by them?
What evidence have we that the record gives us Christ's
words uncorrupted?"</p>

<p>"If you had been brought up in Justin Martyr's time or
the days of the primitive Christians you would have been
put to study all these things first and foremost in your
education, but we modern Christians, teach young men
everything else except what we profess to think the most
important; and so you come out of college ignorant, just
where knowledge is most vital."</p>

<p>"Well, that is past praying for now," said I.</p>

<p>"Yes; but even now there is a way out&mdash;just as going
through a bog you plant your foot hard on what land there
is, and then take your bearings&mdash;so you must do here. The
way to get rid of doubts in religion, is to go to work with all
our might and <em>practice</em> what we <em>don't</em> doubt, and that you
can do whatever your calling or profession."</p>

<p>"I shall certainly try," said I.</p>

<p>"For example," said my uncle, "There's the Sermon on
the Mount. Nobody has any doubt about that, there it lies&mdash;plain
enough, and enough of it&mdash;not a bit of what's called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
theology in it. Not a word of information to settle the
mooted questions men wrangle over, but with a direct answer
to just the questions any thoughtful man must want
to have answered when he looks at life. Is there a Father
in the heavens? Will he help us if we ask? May the
troubles of life be our discipline? Is there a better life
beyond? And how are we to get that? There is Christ's
philosophy of life in that sermon, and Christ's mode of dealing
with actual existing society; and he who undertakes
in good faith to square his heart and life by it will have his
hands full. The world has been traveling eighteen hundred
years and not come fully into the light of its meaning.
There has never been a Christian state or a Christian
nation, according to that. That document is in modern
society just like a lump of soda in a tumbler of vinegar,
it keeps up a constant commotion, and will do so till every
particle of life is adjusted on its principles. The man who
works out Christ's teachings into a palpable life-form,
preaches Christianity, no matter what his trade or calling.
He may be a coal heaver or he may be a merchant, or a
lawyer, or an editor&mdash;he preaches all the same. Men always
know it when they meet a bit of Christ's sermons walking
out bodily in good deeds; they're not like worldly wisdom,
and have a smack of something a good deal higher than
common sense, but when people see it they say, "Yes&mdash;that's
the true thing." Now one of our Presidents, General
Harrison, found out on a certain day that through a flaw in
the title deeds he was owner to half the city of Cincinnati.
What does he do? Why, simply he says to himself, 'These
people have paid their money in good faith, and I'll do by
them as I'd be done by,' and he goes to a lawyer and has
fresh deeds drawn out for the whole of 'em, and lived and
died a poor, honest man. That action was a preaching of
Christ's doctrine as I take it, and if you'll do as much
whenever you get a chance, its no matter what calling you
take for a pulpit. So now tell me what are you thinking of
setting yourself about?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"I intend to devote myself to literature," said I. "I
always had a facility for writing, while I never felt the call
or impulse toward public speaking; and I think the field of
current literature opens a wide scope. I have had already
some success in having articles accepted and well spoken
of, and have now some promising offers. I have an opportunity
to travel in Europe as correspondent of two papers, and
I shall study to improve myself. In time I may become an
editor, and then perhaps at last proprietor of a paper. So
runs my scheme of life, and I hope I shall be true to myself
and my religion in it. I shall certainly try to. Current
literature&mdash;the literature of newspapers and magazines, is
certainly a power."</p>

<p>"A very great power, Harry," said my uncle; "and getting
to be in our day a tremendous power, a power far outgoing
that of the pulpit, and that of books. This constant daily
self-asserting literature of newspapers and periodicals is acting
on us tremendously for good or for ill. It has access to
us at all hours and gets itself heard as a preacher cannot,
and gets itself read as scarcely any book does. It ought to
be entered into as solemnly as the pulpit, for it is using a
great power. Yet just now it is power without responsibility.
It is in the hands of men who come under no pledge,
pass no examination, give no vouchers, though they hold a
power more than that of all other professions or books
united. One cannot be a doctor, or a lawyer, or a minister,
unless some body of his fellows looks into his fitness to
serve society in these ways; but one may be turned loose to
talk in every family twice a day, on every subject, sacred
and profane, and say anything he chooses without even the
safeguard of a personal responsibility. He shall speak from
behind a screen and not be known. Now you know old
Dante says that the souls in the other world were divided
into three classes, those who were for God and those who
were for the Devil, and those who were for neither, but for
themselves. It seems to me that there's a vast many of
these latter at work in our press&mdash;smart literary adventurers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
who don't care a copper what they write up or what
they write down, wholly indifferent which side of a question
they sustain, so they do it smartly, and ready to sell their
wit, their genius and their rhetoric to the highest bidder.
Now, Harry, I'd rather see you a poor, threadbare, hard-worked,
country minister than the smartest and brightest
fellow that ever kept his talents on sale in Vanity Fair."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "isn't it just here that your principle of
living out a Gospel should come? Must there not be writers
for the press who believe in the Sermon on the Mount, and
who are pledged to get its principles into life-forms as fast
as they can?"</p>

<p>"Yea, verily," said my uncle; "but do you mean to keep
faithful to that? You have, say, a good knack at English;
you can write stories, and poems, and essays; you have a
turn for humor; and now comes the Devil to you and says,
Show me up the weak points of those reformers; raise a
laugh at those temperance men,&mdash;those religionists, who,
like all us poor human trash, are running religion, and
morals, and progress into the ground.' You can succeed;
you can carry your world with you. You see, if Virtue
came straight down from Heaven with her white wings and
glistening robes, and always conducted herself just like an
angel, our trial in life wouldn't be so great as it is. But
she doesn't. Human virtue is more apt to appear like a
bewildered, unprotected female, encumbered with all sorts
of irregular bandboxes, dusty, disheveled, out of fashion,
and elbowing her way with ungainly haste and ungraceful
postures. You know there are stories of powerful fairies
who have appeared in this way among men, to try their
hearts; and those who protect them when they are feeble
and dishonored, they reward when they are glorious. Now,
your smart, flippant, second-rate wits never have the grace
to honor Truth when she loses her way, and gets bewildered
and dusty, and they drive a flourishing business in laughing
down the world's poor efforts to grow better."</p>

<p>"I think," said I, "that we Americans have one brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
example of a man who had keen humor, and used it on the
Christian side. The animus of the "Biglow Papers" is the
spirit of the Sermon on the Mount translated into the language
of Yankee life, and defended with wit and drollery."</p>

<p>"You say truth, Harry, and it was no small thing to
do it; for the Anti-Slavery cause then was just in that
chaotic state in which every strange bird and beast, every
shaggy, irregular, unkempt reformer, male and female,
were flocking to it, and there was capital scope for caricature
and ridicule; and all the fastidious, and conservative,
and soft-handed, and even-stepping people were
measureless in their contempt for this shocking rabble.
Lowell stood between them and the world, and fought the
battle with weapons that the world could understand.
There was a Gospel truth in</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">'John P. Robinson, he,'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and it did what no sermon could; this is the more remarkable
because he used for the purpose a harlequin faculty,
that has so often been read out of meeting and excommunicated
that the world had come to look at it as ex-officio
of the Devil. Whittier and Longfellow made valiant music
of the solemn sort, but Lowell evangelized wit."</p>

<p>"The fortunate man," said I, "to have used a great
opportunity!"</p>

<p>"Harry, the only way to be a real man, is to have a cause
you care for more than yourself. That made your father&mdash;that
made your New England Fathers&mdash;that raises literature
above some child's play, and makes it manly&mdash;but if you
would do it you must count on one thing&mdash;that the devil
will tempt you in the outset with the bread question as he
did the Lord.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">"Command that these stones be made bread;"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is the first onset&mdash;you'll want money, and money will be
offered for what you ought not to write. There's the sensational
novel, the blood and murder and adultery story, of
which modern literature is full&mdash;you can produce it&mdash;do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
perhaps as well as anybody&mdash;it will sell. Will you be barkeeper
to the public, and when the public call for hot
brandy sling give it to them, and help them make brutes of
themselves? Will you help to vulgarize and demoralize
literature if it will pay?"</p>

<p>"No;" said I, "not if I know myself."</p>

<p>"Then you've got to begin life with some motive higher
than to make money, or get a living, and you'll have sometimes
to choose between poisonous nonsense that brings pay,
and honest truth that nobody wants."</p>

<p>"And I must tell the Devil that there is a higher life than
the bread-life?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes; get above that, to begin with. Remember the
story of General Marion, who invited some British officers to
dine with him and gave them nothing but roasted potatoes.
They went away and said it was in vain to try to conquer a
people when their officers would live on such fare rather
than give up the cause. Do you know, Harry, what is
my greatest hope for this State? It's this: Two or three
years ago there was urgent need to carry this State in an
election, and there was no end of hard money sent up to buy
votes among our poor farmers: but they couldn't be bought.
They had learned, 'Man shall not live by bread alone,' to
some purpose. The State went all straight for liberty.
What I ask of any man who wants to do a life-work is ability
to be happy on a little."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I have been brought up to that. I have
no expensive habits. I neither drink nor smoke. I am
used to thinking definitely as to figures, and I am willing to
work hard, and begin at the bottom of the ladder, but I
mean to keep my conscience and my religion, and lend a
helping hand to the good cause wherever I can."</p>

<p>"Well, now, my boy, there're only two aids that you need
for this&mdash;one is God, and the other is a true, good woman.
God you will have, but the woman&mdash;she must be found."</p>

<p>I felt the touch on a sore spot, and so answered, purposely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
misunderstanding his meaning. "Yes, I have not to go far
for her&mdash;my mother."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, my boy&mdash;thank God for her; but Harry, you can't
take her away from this place; her roots have spread here;
they are matted and twined with the very soil; they run
under every homestead and embrace every grave. She is
so interwoven with this village that she could not take
root elsewhere, beside that, Harry, look at the clock of
life&mdash;count the years, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, and
the clock never stops! Her hair is all white now, and that
snow will melt by and by, and she will be gone upward.
God grant I may go first, Harry."</p>

<p>"And I, too," said I, fervently. "I could not live without
her."</p>

<p>"You must find one like her, Harry. It is not good for
man to be alone; we all need the motherly, and we must find
it in a wife. Do you know what I think the prettiest story
of courtship I ever read? Its the account of Jacob's marriage
with Rebecca, away back in the simple old times. You
remember the ending of it,&mdash;'And Isaac brought her into
her mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebecca and she became
his wife, and Isaac was comforted for his mother's death.'
There's the philosophy of it," he added; "it's the mother
living again in the wife. The motherly instinct is in the
hearts of all true women, and sooner or later the true wife
becomes a mother to her husband; she guides him, cares
for him, teaches him, and catechises him all in the nicest
way possible. Why I'm sure I never should know how to
get along a day without Polly to teach me the requirings
and forbiddens of the commandments; to lecture me for
going out without my muffler, and see that I put on my
flannels in the right time; to insist that I shall take something
for my cough, and raise a rebellion to my going out
when there's a north-easter. So much for the body, and as
for the soul-life, I believe it is woman who holds faith in
the world&mdash;it is woman behind the wall, casting oil on the
fire that burns brighter and brighter, while the Devil pours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
on water; and you'll never get Christianity out of the earth
while there's a woman in it. I'd rather have my wife's and
your mother's opinion on the meaning of a text of Scripture
than all the doctors of divinity, and their faith is an anchor
that always holds. Some jackanapes or other I read once,
said every woman wanted a master, and was as forlorn
without a husband as a masterless dog. Its a great, deal
truer that every man wants a mother; men are more forlorn
than masterless dogs, a great deal, when no woman cares
for them. Look at the homes single women make for
themselves; how neat, how cosy, how bright with the oil
of gladness, and then look at old bachelor dens! The fact
is, women are born comfort-makers, and can get along by
themselves a great deal better than we can."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I don't think I shall ever marry. Of
course if I could find a woman like my mother, it would be
another thing. But times are altered&mdash;the women of this
day are all for flash and ambition, and money. There are
no more such as you used to find in the old days."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Harry; don't come to me with that sort
of talk. Bad sort for a young man&mdash;very. What I want to
see in a young fellow is a resolution to have a good wife
and a home of his own as quick as he can find it. The
Roman Catholics weren't so far out of the way when they
said marriage was a sacrament. It is the greatest sacrament
of life, and that old church does yeoman service to
humanity in the stand she takes for Christian marriage. I
should call that the most prosperous state when all the
young men and women were well mated and helping one
another according to God's ordinances. You may be sure,
Harry, that you can never be a whole man without a wife."</p>

<p>"Well," I said; "there's time enough for that by and by;
if I'm predestinated I suppose it'll come along when I have
my fortune made."</p>

<p>"Don't wait to be rich, Harry. Find a faithful, heroic
friend that will strike hands with you, poor, and begin to
build up your nest together,&mdash;that's the way your father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
mother did, and who enjoyed more? That's the way your
Aunt Polly and I did, and a good time we have had of it.
There has always been the handful of meal in the barrel and
the little oil in the cruse, and if the way we have always
lived is poverty, all I have to say is, poverty is a pretty nice
thing."</p>

<p>"But," said I, bitterly, "you talk of golden ages. There
are no such women now as you found, the women now are
mere effeminate dolls of fashion&mdash;all they want is ease and
show, and luxury, and they care nothing who gives it&mdash;one
man is as good as another if he is only rich."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, boy! Don't you read your Bible? Away back
in Solomon's time, it's written, 'Who can find a virtuous
woman? Her price is above rubies.' Are rubies found
without looking for them, and do diamonds lie about the
street? Now, just attend to my words&mdash;brave men make
noble women, and noble women make brave men. Be a true
man first, and some day a true woman will be given you.
Yes, a woman whose opinion of you will hold you up if all
the world were against you, and whose 'Well done!' will be
a better thing to come home to, than the senseless shouting
of the world who scream for this thing to-day and that
to-morrow."</p>

<p>By this time the horse had turned up the lane, and my
mother stood smiling in the door. I marked the soft
white hair that shone like a moonlight glory round her
head, and prayed inwardly that the heavens would spare
her yet a little longer.</p>

<p class="ph3">COUSIN CAROLINE.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap2" src="images/drop_y-quote.jpg" width="74" height="60" alt="" /> </div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="upper-case">"You</span> must go and see your
cousin Caroline," said my mother, the first evening after I got home;
"you've no idea how pretty she's grown."</p>

<p>"She's what I call a pattern girl," said my uncle Jacob, "a
girl that can make the most of life."</p>

<p>"She is a model housekeeper and manager," said Aunt
Polly.</p>

<p>Now if Aunt Polly called a girl a model house-keeper, it
was the same for her that it would be for a man to receive
a doctorate from a college; in fact it would be a good deal
more, as Aunt Polly was one who always measured her
words, and never said anything <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pro forma</i>, or without
having narrowly examined the premises.</p>

<p>Elderly people who live in happy matrimony are in a
gentle way disposed to be match-makers. If they have
sense, as my elders did, they do not show this disposition
in any very pronounced way. They never advise a young
man directly to try his fortune with "So and so," knowing
that that would, in nine cases out of ten, be the direct way
to defeat their purpose. So my mother's gentle suggestion,
and my uncle Jacob's praise, and Aunt Polly's endorsement,
were simply in the line of the most natural remarks.</p>

<p>Cousin Caroline was the daughter of Uncle Jacob's brother,
the only daughter in the family. Her father was one of
those men most useful and necessary in society, composed
of virtues and properties wholly masculine. He was strong,
energetic, shrewd, acridly conscientious, and with an intensity
of self-will and love of domination. This rugged
rock, all granite, had won a tender woman to nestle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
flower in some crevice of his heart and she had clothed
him with a garland of sons and one flower of a daughter.
Within a year or two her death had left this daughter the
mistress of her father's family. I remembered Caroline of
old, as my school companion; the leading scholar, in every
study, always good natured, steady, and clear-headed, ready
to help me when I faltered in a translation, or the solution
of an algebraic problem. In those days I never thought of
her as pretty. There were the outlines and rudiments,
which might bloom into beauty, but thin, pale, colorless,
and deficient in roundness and grace.</p>

<p>I had seen very little of Caroline through my college
life; we had exchanged occasionally a cousinly letter, but
in my last vacation she was away upon a visit. I was
not, therefore, prepared for the vision which bloomed out
upon me from the singer's seat, when I looked up on
Sunday and saw her, standing in a shaft of sunlight
that lit up her whole form with a kind of glory. I rubbed
my eyes with astonishment, as I saw there a very beautiful
woman, and beautiful in quite an uncommon style, one
which promised a more lasting continuance of personal
attraction than is usual with our New England girls. I
own, that a head and bust of the Venus de Milo type; a
figure at once graceful, yet ample in its proportions; a rich,
glowing bloom, speaking of health and vigor,&mdash;gave a new
radiance to eyes that I had always admired, in days when
I never had thought of even raising the question of Caroline's
beauty. These charms were set off, too, by a native
talent for dress,&mdash;that sort of instinctive gift that some
women have of arranging their toilet so as exactly to suit
their own peculiar style. There was nothing fussy, or furbelowed,
or gaudy, as one often sees in the dress of a
country beauty, but a grand and severe simplicity, which
in her case was the very perfection of art.</p>

<p>My Uncle Ebenezer Simmons lived at a distance of nearly
two miles from our house, but that evening, after tea, I
announced to my mother that I was going to take a walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
over to see cousin Caroline. I perceived that the movement
was extremely popular and satisfactory in the eyes of all the
domestic circle.</p>

<p>Whose thoughts do not travel in this direction, I wonder,
in a small country neighborhood? Here comes Harry Henderson
home from college, with his laurels on his brow, and
here is the handsomest girl in the neighborhood, a pattern
of all the virtues. What is there to be done, except that
they should straightway fall in love with each other, and
taking hold of hands walk up the Hill Difficulty together?
I presume that no good gossip in our native village saw any
other arrangement of our destiny as possible or probable.</p>

<p>I may just as well tell my readers first as last, that we
did not fall in love with each other, though we were the very
best friends possible, and I spent nearly half my time at my
uncle's house, besetting her at all hours, and having the best
possible time in her society; but our relations were as
frankly and clearly those of brother and sister as if we had
been children of one mother.</p>

<p>For a beautiful woman, Caroline had the least of what one
may call legitimate coquetry, of any person I ever saw.
There are some women, and women of a high class too, who
seem to take a natural and innocent pleasure in the power
which their sex enables them to exercise over men, and
who instinctively do a thousand things to captivate and
charm one of the opposite sex, even when they would greatly
regret winning his whole heart. If well principled and
instructed they try to keep themselves under control, but
they still do a thousand ensnaring things, for no other reason,
that I can see, than that it is their nature, and they cannot
help it. If they have less principle this faculty becomes
then available power, by which they can take possession of
all that a man has, and use it to carry their own plans and
purposes.</p>

<p>Of this power, whatever it may be, Caroline had nothing;
nay, more, she despised it, and received the admiration and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
attentions which her beauty drew from the opposite sex,
with a coldness, in some instances amounting to incivility.</p>

<p>With me she had been from the first so frankly, cheerfully
and undisguisedly affectionate and kind, and with such a
straightforward air of comradeship and a literal ignoring of
everything sentimental, that the very ground of anything
like love-making did not seem to exist between us. The
last evening before I was to leave for my voyage to Europe,
I spent with her, and she gave me a curiously-wrought
traveling-case, in which there was a pocket for any imaginable
thing that a bachelor might be supposed to want on his
travels.</p>

<p>"I wish I could go with you," she said to me, with an
energy quite out of her usual line.</p>

<p>"I am sure I wish you could," said I; and what with the
natural softness of heart that a young man feels, when he
is plunging off from the safe ground of home into the world
and partly from the unwonted glow of feeling that came
over Caroline's face, as she spoke, I felt quite a rush of
emotion, and said, as I kissed her hand, "Why didn't we
think of this before, Caroline?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Henry; don't you be sentimental, of all
things," she replied briskly, withdrawing her hand. "Of
course, I didn't mean anything more than that I wished I
was a young fellow like you, free to take my staff and
bundle, and make my way in the great world. Why couldn't
I be?"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em>," said I, "Caroline, you, with your beauty and your
talents,&mdash;I think you might be satisfied with a woman's lot
in life."</p>

<p>"A woman's lot! and what is that, pray? to sit with folded
hands and see life drifting by&mdash;to be a mere nullity, and
endure to have my good friends pat me on the back, and
think I am a bright and shining light of contentment in
woman's sphere?"</p>

<p>"But," said I, "you know, Caroline, that there is always a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
possibility in woman's destiny, especially a woman so beautiful
as you are."</p>

<p>"You mean marriage. Well, perhaps if I could do as you
can, go all over the world, examine and search for the one I
want, and find him, the case would be somewhat equal;
but my chances are only among those who propose to me.
Now, I have read in the Arabian Nights of princesses so
beautiful that men came in regiments, to seek the honor of
their hand; but such things don't occur in our times in New
England villages. My list for selection must be confined to
such of the eligible men in this neighborhood as are in want
of wives; men who want wives as they do cooking-stoves,
and make up their minds that I may suit them. By the
by, I have been informed already of one who has had me
under consideration, and concluded <em>not</em> to take me. Silas
Boardman, I understand, has made up his mind, and informed
his sisters of the fact, that I am altogether too
dressy in my taste for his limited means, and besides that
I am too free and independent; so that door is closed to me,
you'll observe. Silas won't have me!"</p>

<p>"The conceited puppy!" said I.</p>

<p>"Well, isn't that the common understanding among men&mdash;that
all the marriageable girls in their neighborhood are
on exhibition for their convenience? If the very first idea of
marriage with any one of them were not so intensely disagreeable
to me, I would almost be willing to let some of
them ask me, just to hear what I could tell them. Now you
know, Harry, I put <em>you</em> out of the case, because you are
my cousin, and I no more think of you in that way than if
you were my brother, but, frankly, I never yet saw the man
that I could by any stretch of imagination conceive of my
wanting, or being willing to marry; I know no man that it
wouldn't be an untold honor to me to be doomed to marry.
I would rather scrub floors on my knees for a living."</p>

<p>"But you do see happy marriages."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, dear souls, of course I do, and am glad of it,
and wonder and admire; yes, I see some happy marriages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
There's Uncle Jacob and his wife, kind old souls, two dear
old pigeons of the sanctuary!&mdash;how charmingly they get
along! and your father and mother&mdash;they seemed one soul;
it really was encouraging to see that people could live so."</p>

<p>"But you musn't be too ideal, Caroline; you musn't
demand too much of a man."</p>

<p>"Demand? I don't demand anything of any man, I only
want to be let alone. I don't want to wait for a husband to
make me a position, I want to make one for myself; I don't
want to take a husband's money, I want my own. You have
individual ideas of life, you want to work them out; so have
I: you are expected and encouraged to work them out
independently, while I am forbidden. Now, what would
you say if somebody told you to sit down quietly in the
domestic circle and read to your mother, and keep the wood
split and piled, and the hearth swept, and diffuse a sweet
perfume of domestic goodness, like the violet amid its leaves,
till by and by some woman should come and give you a
fortune and position, and develop your affections,&mdash;how
would you like that? Now the case with me is just here,
I am, if you choose to say it, so ideal and peculiar in my
views that there is no reasonable prospect that I shall ever
marry, but I want a position, a house and home of my own,
and a sphere of independent action, and everybody thinks
this absurd and nobody helps me. As long as mother was
alive, there was some consolation in feeling that I was everything
to her. Poor soul! she had a hard life, and I was her
greatest pride and comfort, but now she is gone, there is
nothing I do for my father that a good, smart housekeeper
could not be hired to do; but you see that would cost money,
and the money that I thus save is invested without consulting
me: it goes to buy more rocky land, when we have already
more than we know what to do with. I sacrifice all my tastes,
I stunt my growth mentally and intellectually to this daily
tread-mill of house and dairy, and yet I have not a cent that
I can call my own, I am a servant working for board and
clothes, and because I am a daughter I am expected to do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cheerfully; my only escape from this position is to take a
similar one in the family of some man to whom, in addition
to the superintendence of his household, I shall owe the
personal duties of a wife, and <em>that</em> way out you may know
I shall never take. So you are sure to find me ten or twenty
years hence a fixture in this neighborhood, spoken of familiarly
as 'old Miss Caroline Simmons,' a cross-pious old maid,
held up as a warning to contumacious young beauties how
they neglect their first gracious offer. 'Caroline was a
handsome gal in her time,' they'll say, 'but she was too perticklar,
and now her day is over and she's left an old maid.
She held her head too high and said "No" a little too often;
ye see, gals better take their fust chances.'"</p>

<p>"After all, cousin," I said, "though we men are all unworthy
sinners, yet sometimes you women do yield to much
persuasion, and take some one out of pity."</p>

<p>"I can't do that; in fact I have tried to do it, and can't.
This desperate dullness, and restraint, and utter paralysis of
progress that lies like a nightmare on one, is a dreadful
temptation; when a man offers you a fortune, which will give
you ease, leisure, and power to follow all your tastes and a
certain independent stand, such as unmarried women cannot
take, it is a great temptation."</p>

<p>"But you resisted it!"</p>

<p>"Well, I was sorely tried; there were things I wanted
desperately&mdash;a splendid house in Boston, pictures, carriages,
servants,&mdash;oh, I did want them; I wanted the éclat, too, of a
rich marriage, but I couldn't; the man was too good a man
to be trifled with; if he would only have been a good uncle
or grandpa I would have loved him dearly, and been ever so
devoted, kept his house beautifully, waited on him like a
dutiful daughter, read to him, sung to him, nursed him,
been the best friend in the world to him, but his <em>wife</em> I could
not be; the very idea of it made the worthy creature perfectly
repulsive and hateful to me."</p>

<p>"Did you ever try to tell your father how you feel?"</p>

<p>"Of what earthly use? There are people in this world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
who don't understand each other's vernacular. Papa and I
could no more discuss any question of the inner life together
than if he spoke Chickasaw and I spoke French. Papa has
a respect for my practical efficiency and business talent, and
in a certain range of ideas we get on well together. He
thinks I have made a great mistake, and that there is a crack
in my head somewhere, but he says nothing; his idea is
that I have let slip the only chance of my life, but still, as I
am a great convenience at home, he is reconciled. I suppose
all my friends mourn in secret places over me, and I should
have been applauded and commended on all hands if I had
done it; but, after all, wouldn't it be a great deal more
honest, more womanly, more like a reasonable creature, for
me to do just what you are doing, fit myself to make my
own way, and make an independence for myself? Really
it isn't honest to take a position where you know you can't
give the main thing asked for, and keep out somebody perhaps
who can. My friend has made himself happy with a
woman who perfectly adores him, and ought to be much
obliged to me that I didn't take him at his word; good, silly
soul that he was."</p>

<p>"But, after all, the Prince may come&mdash;the fated knight&mdash;Caroline."</p>

<p>"And deliver the distressed damsel?" she said, laughing.
"Well, when he comes I'll show him my 'swan's nest among
the reeds.' Soberly, the fact is, cousin," she said, "you men
don't know us women. In the first place they say that there
are more of us born than there are of you: and that doesn't
happen merely to give you a good number to choose from,
and enable every widower to find a supernumerary; it is
because it was meant that some women should lead a life
different from the domestic one. The womanly nature can
be of use otherwhere besides in marriage, in our world. To
be sure, for the largest class of women there is nothing
like marriage, and I suppose the usages of society are made
for the majority, and exceptional people mustn't grumble if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they don't find things comfortable; but I am persuaded that
there is a work and a way for those who cannot marry."</p>

<p>"Well, there's Uncle Jacob has just been preaching to me
that no <em>man</em> can be developed fully without a wife," said I.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jacob has matrimony on the brain! it's lucky he
isn't a despotic Czar or, I believe, he'd marry all the men
and women, <em>wille nille</em>. I grant that the rare, real marriage,
that occurs one time in a hundred, is the true ideal state
for man and woman, but it doesn't follow that all and everything
that brings man and woman together in marriage
is blessed, and I take my stand on St. Paul's doctrine that
there are both men and women called to some higher state;
now, it seems to me that the number of these increases
with the advancement of society. Marriage requires so
close an intimacy that there must be perfect agreement and
sympathy; the lower down in the scale of being one is, the
fewer distinctive points there are of difference or agreement.
It is easier for John and Patrick, and Bridget and Katy, to
find comfortable sympathy and agreement than it is for
those far up in the scale of life where education has developed
a thousand individual tastes and peculiarities. We
read in history of the Rape of the Sabines, and how the
women thus carried off at hap-hazard took so kindly to their
husbands that they wouldn't be taken back again. Such
things are only possible in the barbarous stages of society,
when characters are very rudimentary and simple. If a
similar experiment were made on women of the cultivated
classes in our times I fancy some of the men would be killed;
I know <em>one</em> would,"&mdash;she said with an energetic grasp of her
little fist and a flash out of her eyes.</p>

<p>"But the ideal marriage is the thing to be sought,"
said I.</p>

<p>"For you, who are born with the right to seek, it <em>is</em> the
thing to be sought," she said; "for me, who am born to
wait till I am sought by exactly the right one, the chances
are so infinitesimal that they ought not to be considered;
I may have a fortune left me, and die a millionaire; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
is no actual impossibility in <em>that</em> thing's happening&mdash;it is a
thing that has happened to people who expected it as little
as I do&mdash;but it would be the height of absurdity to base
any calculation upon it and yet all the arrangements that
are made about me and for me, are made on the presumption
that I am to marry. I went to Uncle Jacob and tried to
get him to take me through a course of medical study, to
fit me for a professional life, and it was impossible to get
him to take any serious view of it, or to believe what I said;
he seemed really to think I was plotting to upset the Bible
and the Constitution, in planning for an independent life."</p>

<p>"After all, Caroline, you must pardon me if I say that it
does not seem possible that a woman like you will be allowed&mdash;that
is you know&mdash;you will&mdash;well&mdash;find somebody&mdash;that is,
you will be less exacting by and by."</p>

<p>"Exacting! why do you use that word, when I don't exact
anything? I am not so very ideal in my tastes, I am only
<em>individual</em>; I must have in myself a certain feeling towards
this possible individual, and I don't find it. In one case certainly
I asked myself why I didn't? The man was all he
should be, I didn't object to him in the slightest degree as
a man; but looked on respecting the marriage relation, he
was simply intolerable. It must be that I have no vocation
to marry, and yet I want what any live woman wants; I
want something of my own; I want a life-work worth doing;
I want a home of my own; I want money that I can use as
I please, that I can give and withhold, and dispose of as absolutely
<em>mine</em>, and not another's; and the world seems all
arranged so as to hinder my getting it. If a man wants
to get an education there are colleges with rich foundations,
where endowments have been heaped up, and scholarships
founded, to enable him to prepare for life at reasonable
expense. There are no such for women, and their schools,
such as they are, infinitely poorer than those given to men,
involve double the expense. If you ask a professional man
to teach you privately, he laughs at you, compliments you,
and sends you away with the feeling that he considers you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a silly, cracked-brain girl, or perhaps an unsuccessful angler
in matrimonial waters; he seems to think that there is no
use teaching you, because you will throw down all, and
run for the first man that beckons to you. That sort of
presumption is insufferable to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, Carrie, you know those old Doctors, they get a
certain jog-trot way of arranging human life; and then
men that are happily married are in such bliss, and such
women-worshipers that they cannot make up their mind
that anybody they care about should not enter their paradise."</p>

<p>"I do not despise their paradise," said Caroline; "I think
everybody most happy that can enter it. I am thankful
to see that they can. I am delighted and astonished every
day at beholding the bliss and satisfaction with which really
nice, pretty girls take up with the men they do, and I think
it all very delightful; but it's rather hard on me that, since
I can't have that, I mustn't have anything else."</p>

<p>"After all, Caroline, is not your dissatisfaction with the
laws of nature?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly; I won't quarrel with the will that made me
a woman, not in my deepest heart. Neither being a woman
do I want to be unwomanly. I would not, if I could, do
as Georges Sand did, put on men's clothes and live a man's
life. Anything of that sort in a woman is very repulsive
and disgusting to me. At the same time, I do think that
the customs and laws of society might be modified so as to
give to women who do not choose to marry, independent
position and means of securing home and fortune. Marriage
never ought to be entered on as a means of support.
It seems to me that our sex are enough weighted by nature,
and that therefore all the laws and institutions of society
ought to act in just the contrary direction, and tend to hold
us up&mdash;to widen our way, to encourage our efforts, because
we are the weaker party, and need it most. The world
is now arranged for the strong, and I think it ought to be
re-arranged for the weak."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>I paused, and pondered all that she had been saying.</p>

<p>"My mother&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Now, please don't quote your mother to me. I know
what she would say. If two angels were sent down from
Heaven, the one to govern an empire, and the other to
sweep the streets, they would not wish to change with
each other; it is perhaps true.</p>

<p>"But then, you see, that is only possible because they
are angels. Your mother has got up somewhere into that
region, but I am down in the low lands, and must do the best
I can on my plane. I can conceive of those moral heights
where one thing is just as agreeable as another, but I have
not yet reached them. Besides, you know Jacob wrestled
with his angel, and was commended for it; and I think we
ought to satisfy ourselves by good, strong effort that our
lot <em>is</em> of God. If we really cannot help ourselves, we may
be resigned to it as His will."</p>

<p>"Caroline," I said, "if you might have exactly what you
want, what would it have been?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, then, exactly the same education with
my brothers. I hear of colleges now, somewhere far out
west, where a brother and sister may go through the same
course together; that would have suited me. I am impatient
of half-education. I am by nature very thorough
and exact. I want to be sure of doing whatever I undertake
as well as it can be done. I don't want to be flattered
and petted for pretty ignorance. I don't want to
be tolerated in any half way, slovenly work of any kind
because I am a woman. When I have a thorough general
education, I then want to make professional studies. I have
a great aptitude for medicine. I have a natural turn for the
care of sick, and am now sent for far and near as one of
the best advisers and watchers in case of sickness. In that
profession I don't doubt I might do great good, be very
happy, have a cheerful home of own, and a pleasant life-work;
but I don't want to enter it half taught. I want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
be able to do as good work as any man's; to be held to
the same account, and receive only what I can fairly win."</p>

<p>"But, Caroline, a man's life includes so much drudgery."</p>

<p>"And does not mine? Do you suppose that the care of
all the house and dairy, the oversight of all my father's
home affairs, is no drudgery? Much of it is done with my
own hands, because no other work than mine can content
me. But when you and I went to school together, it was
just so: you know I worked out my own problems and made
my own investigations. Now all that is laid aside; at least,
all my efforts are so hap-hazard and painfully incomplete,
that it is discouraging to me."</p>

<p>"But would not your father consent?"</p>

<p>"My father is a man wedded to the past, and set against
every change in ideas. I have tried to get his consent
to let me go and study, and prepare myself to do something
worth doing, but he is perfectly immovable. He says
I know more now than half the women, and a great deal
too much for my good, and that he cannot spare me. At
twenty-one he makes no further claim on any of my brothers;
their minority comes to an end at a certain period&mdash;mine,
never."</p>

<p>We were walking in the moonlight up and down under
the trees by the house. Caroline suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>"Cousin," she said, "if you succeed; if you get to be what
I hope you will&mdash;high in the world, a prosperous editor&mdash;speak
for the dumb, for us whose lives burn themselves
out into white ashes in silence and repression."</p>

<p>"I <em>will</em>," I said.</p>

<p>"You will write to me; I shall rejoice to hear of the
world through you&mdash;and I shall rejoice in your success," she
added.</p>

<p>"Caroline," I said, "do you give up entirely wrestling
with the angel?"</p>

<p>"No; if I did, I should not keep up. I have hope from
year to year that something may happen to bring things to
my wishes; that I may obtain a hearing with papa; that his
sense of justice may be aroused; that I may get Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Jacob to do something besides recite verses and compliment
me; that your mother may speak for me."</p>

<p>"You have never told your heart to my mother?"</p>

<p>"No; I am very reticent, and these adoring wives have
but one recipe for all our troubles."</p>

<p>"I think, Caroline, that her's is a wide, free nature, that
takes views above the ordinary level of things, and that she
would understand and might work for you. Tell her what
you have been telling me."</p>

<p>"You may, if you please. I will talk with her afterward
perhaps she will do something for me."</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="ph3">WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HER?</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> next day I spoke to my uncle Jacob of Caroline's
desire to study, and said that some way ought to
be provided for taking her out of her present
confined limits.</p>

<p>He looked at me with a shrewd, quizzical expression, and
said: "Providence generally opens a way out for girls as
handsome as she is. Caroline is a little restless just at
present, and so is getting some of these modern strong-minded
notions into her head. The fact is, that our region
is a little too much out of the world; there is nobody around
here, probably, that she would think a suitable match for
her. Caroline ought to visit, now, and cruise about a little
in some of the watering-places next summer, and be seen.
There are few girls with a finer air, or more sure to make
a sensation. I fancy she would soon find the right sphere
under these circumstances."</p>

<p>"But does it not occur to you, uncle, that the very idea
of going out into the world, seeking to attract and fall in
the way of offers of marriage, is one from which such a spirit
as Caroline's must revolt? Is there not something essentially
unwomanly in it&mdash;something humiliating? I know,
myself, that she is too proud, too justly self-respecting,
to do it. And why should a superior woman be condemned
to smother her whole nature, to bind down all her faculties,
and <em>wait</em> for occupation in a sphere which it is unwomanly
to seek directly, and unwomanly to accept when
offered to her, unless offered by the one of a thousand for
whom she can have a certain feeling?"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth," said my uncle, looking at me again,
"I always thought in my heart that Caroline was just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
proper person for <em>you</em>&mdash;just the woman you need&mdash;brave,
strong, and yet lovely; and I don't see any objection in the
way of <em>your</em> taking her."</p>

<p>Elderly people of a benevolent turn often get a matter-of-fact
way of arranging the affairs of their juniors that is
sufficiently amusing. My uncle spoke with a confidential
air of good faith of my taking Caroline as if she had been
a lot of land up for sale. Seeing my look of blank embarrassment,
he went on:</p>

<p>"You perhaps think the relationship an objection, but I
have my own views on that subject. The only objection
to the intermarriage of cousins is one that depends entirely
on similarity of race peculiarities. Sometimes cousins
inheriting each from different races, are physiologically as
much of diverse blood as if their parents had not been
related, and in that case there isn't the slightest objection
to marriage. Now, Caroline, though her father is your
mother's brother, inherits evidently the Selwyn blood.
She's all her mother, or rather her grandmother, who was a
celebrated beauty. Caroline is a Selwyn, every inch, and
you are as free to marry her as any woman you can meet."</p>

<p>"You talk as if she were a golden apple, that I had nothing
to do but reach forth my hand to pick," said I. "Did it
never occur to you that I <em>couldn't</em> take her if I were to try?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Uncle Jacob, looking me over
in a manner which indicated a complimentary opinion.
"I'm not so sure of that. She's not in the way of seeing
many men superior to you."</p>

<p>"And suppose that she were that sort of woman who did
not wish to marry at all?" said I.</p>

<p>My uncle looked quizzical, and said, "I doubt the existence
of that species."</p>

<p>"It appears to me," said I, "that Caroline is by nature so
much more fitted for the life of a scholar than that of an
ordinary domestic woman, that nothing but a most absorbing
and extraordinary amount of personal affection would
ever make the routine of domestic life agreeable to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
She is very fastidious and individual in her tastes, too, and
the probabilities of her finding the person whom she could
love in this manner are very small. Now it appears to me
that the taking for granted that all women, without respect
to taste or temperament, must have no sphere or opening
for their faculties except domestic life, is as great an
absurdity in our modern civilization as the stupid custom of
half-civilized nations, by which every son, no matter what
his character, is obliged to confine himself to the trade of
his father. I should have felt it a hardship to be condemned
always to be a shoemaker if my father had been
one."</p>

<p>"Nay," said my uncle, "the cases are not parallel. The
domestic sphere of wife and mother to which woman is
called, is divine and god-like; it is sacred, and solemn, and
no woman can go higher than that, and anything else to
which she devotes herself, falls infinitely below it."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said I, "let me use another simile. My father
was a minister, and I reverence and almost adore the ideal
of such a minister, and such a ministry as his was. Yet it
would be an oppression on me to constrain me to enter into
it. I am not adapted to it, or fitted for it. I should make
a failure in it, while I might succeed in a lower sphere.
Now it seems to me that just as no one should enter the
ministry as a means of support or worldly position, but
wholly from a divine enthusiasm, so no woman should enter
marriage for provision, or station, or support; but simply
and only from the most purely personal affection. And my
theory of life would be, to have society so arranged that
independent woman shall have every facility for developing
her mind and perfecting herself that independent man
has, and every opportunity in society for acquiring and
holding property, for securing influence, and position, and
fame, just as man can. If laws are to make any difference
between the two sexes, they ought to help, and not to
hinder the weaker party. Then, I think, a man might feel
that his wife came to him from the purest and highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
kind of love&mdash;not driven to him as a refuge, not compelled
to take him as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dernier resort</i>, not struggling and striving
to bring her mind to him, because she <em>must</em> marry somebody,&mdash;but
choosing him intelligently and freely, because he
is <em>the one</em> more to her than all the world beside."</p>

<p>"Well," said my uncle, regretfully, "of course I don't
want to be a matchmaker, but I did hope that you and
Caroline would be so agreed; and I think now, that if you
would try, you might put these notions out of her head, and
put yourself in their place."</p>

<p>"And what if I had tried, and become certain that it was
of no use?"</p>

<p>"You don't say she has refused you!" said my uncle, with
a start.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" said I. "Caroline is one of those women
whose whole manner keeps off entirely all approaches of
that kind. You may rely upon it, uncle, that while she
loves me as frankly and truly and honestly as ever sister
loved a brother, yet I am perfectly convinced that it is
mainly because I have kept myself clear of any misunderstanding
of her noble frankness, or any presumption
founded upon it. Her love to me is honest comradeship,
just such as I might have from a college mate, and there
is not the least danger of its sliding into anything else.
There may be an Endymion to this Diana, but it certainly
won't be Harry Henderson."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said my uncle. "Well, I'm afraid then that she
never will marry, and you certainly must grant that a
woman unmarried remains forever undeveloped and incomplete."</p>

<p>"No more than a man," said I. "A man who never
becomes a father is incomplete in one great resemblance to
the divine being. Yet there have been men with the element
of fatherhood more largely developed in celibacy than
most are in marriage. There was Fénelon, for instance,
who was married to humanity. Every human being that
he met held the place of a child in his heart. No individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
experience of fatherhood could make such men as he more
fatherly. And in like manner there are women with more
natural motherhood than many mothers. Such are to be
found in the sisterhoods that gather together lost and orphan
children, and are their mothers in God. There are natures
who do not need the development of marriage; they know
instinctively all it can teach them. But they are found only
in the rarest and highest regions."</p>

<p>"Well," said my uncle, "for every kind of existence in
creation God has made a mate, and the eagles that live on
mountain tops, and fly toward the sun, have still their
kindred eagles. Now, I think, for my part, that if Fénelon
had married Madame Guyon, he would have had a richer
and a happier life of it, and she would have gone off into
fewer vagaries, and they would have left the Church some
splendid children, who might, perhaps, have been born
without total depravity. You see these perfected specimens
owe it to humanity to perpetuate their kind."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "let them do it by spiritual fatherhood
and motherhood. St. Paul speaks often of his converts
as those begotten of him&mdash;the children of his soul; a thousand-fold
more of them there were, than there could have
been if he had weighted himself with the care of an individual
family. Think of the spiritual children of Plato and
St. Augustine!"</p>

<p>"This may be all very fine, youngster," said, my uncle,
"but very exceptional; yet for all that, I should be sorry
to see a fine woman like Caroline withering into an old
maid."</p>

<p>"She certainly will," said I, "unless you and mother
stretch forth your hands and give her liberty to seek her
destiny in the mode in which nature inclines her. You
will never get <em>her</em> to go husband-hunting. The mere idea
suggested to her of exhibiting her charms in places of resort,
in the vague hope of being chosen, would be sufficient to
keep her out of society. She has one of those independent
natures to which it is just as necessary for happiness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
she should make her own way, and just as irksome to
depend on others, as it is for most young men. She has a
fine philosophic mind, great powers of acquisition, a curiosity
for scientific research; and her desire is to fit herself
for a physician,&mdash;a sphere perfectly womanly, and in which
the motherly nature of woman can be most beautifully
developed. Now, help her with your knowledge through
the introductory stages of study, and use your influence
afterward to get her father to give her wider advantages."</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is," said my uncle, "Caroline <em>is</em> a splendid
nurse; she has great physical strength and endurance,
great courage and presence of mind, and a wonderful
power of consoling and comforting sick people. She has
borrowed some of my books, and seemed to show a considerable
acuteness in her remarks on them. But somehow the
idea that a lovely young woman should devote herself to
medicine, has seemed to me a great waste, and I never
seriously encouraged it."</p>

<p>"Depend upon it," said I, "Caroline is a woman who will
become more charming in proportion as she moves more
thoroughly and perfectly in the sphere for which nature
has adapted her. Keep a great, stately, white swan shut up
in a barn-yard and she has an ungainly gait, becomes
morose, and loses her beautiful feathers; but set her free
to glide off into her native element and all is harmonious
and beautiful. A superior woman, gifted with personal
attractions, who is forgetting herself in the enthusiasm of
some high calling or profession, never becomes an old
maid; she does not wither; she advances as life goes on,
and often keeps her charms longer than the matron exhausted
by family cares and motherhood. A charming
woman, fully and happily settled and employed in a life-work
which is all in all to her, is far more likely to be
attractive and to be sought than one who enters the ranks of
the fashionable waiters on Providence."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said my uncle, "I'll think of it. The fact is,
we fellows of three-score ought to be knocked on the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
peaceably. We have the bother of being progressive all
through our youth, and by the time we get something
settled, up comes your next generation and begins kicking
it all over. It's too bad to demolish the house we spend
our youth in building just when we want rest, and don't
want the fatigue of building over."</p>

<p>"For that matter," said I, "the modern ideas of woman's
sphere were all thought out and expressed in the Greek
mythology ages and ages ago. The Greeks didn't fit every
woman to one type. There was their pretty, plump little
Aphrodite, and their godlike Venus de Milo; there was
Diana&mdash;the woman of cold, bright, pure physical organization,&mdash;independent,
free, vigorous. There was Minerva, the
impersonation of the purely intellectual woman, who neither
wished nor sought marriage. There was Juno, the house-keeper
and domestic queen, and Ceres, the bread-giver and
provider. In short, the Greeks conceived a variety of
spheres of womanhood; but we, in modern times, have
reduced all to one&mdash;the vine that twines, and the violet hid
in the leaves; as if the Victoria Regia hadn't as good a right
to grow as the daisy, and as if there were not female oaks
and pines as well as male!"</p>

<p>"Well, after all," he said, "the prevalent type of sex
through nature, is that of strength for man and dependence
for woman."</p>

<p>"Nay," said I; "if you appeal to nature in this matter of
sex, there is the female element in grand and powerful forms,
as well as in gentle and dependent ones. The she-lion and
tiger are more terrible and untamable than the male. The
Greek mythology was a perfect reflection of nature, and
clothed woman with majesty and power as well as with
grace; how splendid those descriptions of Homer are,
where Minerva, clad in celestial armor, leads the forces of
the Greeks to battle! What vigor there is in their impersonation
of the Diana; the woman strong in herself, scorning
physical passion, and terrible to approach in the radiant
majesty of her beauty, striking with death the vulgar curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that dared to profane her sanctuary! That was the
ideal of a woman, self-sufficient, victorious, and capable of
a grand, free, proud life of her own, not needing to depend
upon man. The Greeks never would have imagined such
goddesses if they had not seen such women, and our modern
civilization is imperfect if it does not provide a place and
sphere for such types of womanhood. It takes all sorts of
people to make up a world, and there ought to be provision,
toleration, and free course for all sorts."</p>

<p>"Well, youngster," said my uncle, "I think you'll write
tolerable leaders for some radical paper, one of these days,
but you fellows that want to get into the chariot of the sun
and drive it, had better think a little before you set the
world on fire. As for your Diana, I thank Heaven she isn't
<em>my</em> wife, and I think it would be pretty cold picking with
your Minerva."</p>

<p>"Permit me to say, uncle, that in this 'latter day glory' that
is coming, men have got to learn to judge women by some
other standard than what would make good wives <em>for them</em>,
and acknowledge sometimes a femininity existing in and for
itself. As there is a possible manhood complete without
woman, so there is a possible womanhood complete without
man."</p>

<p>"That's not the Christian idea," said my uncle.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I replied, "but I believe it is exactly what
St. Paul meant when he spoke of the state of celibacy, in
devotion to the higher spiritual life, as being a higher state
for some men and women than marriage."</p>

<p>"You are on dangerous ground there," said my uncle, "you
will run right into monastic absurdity."</p>

<p>"High grounds are always dangerous grounds," said I,
"full of pitfalls and precipices, yet the Lord has persisted in
making mountains, precipices, pitfalls, and all, and being
made they may as well be explored, even at the risk of
breaking one's neck. We may as well look every question
in the face, and run every inquiry to its ultimate."</p>

<p>"Go it then," said my uncle, "and joy go with you; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
chariot of the sun is the place for a prospect! Up with you
into it, my boy, that kind of driving is interesting; in fact,
when I was young, I should have liked it myself, but if
you don't want to kick up as great a bobbery as Phæton did,
you'd better mind his father's advice: spare the whip, and
use the reins with those fiery horses of the future."</p>

<p>"But, now," said I, "as the final result of all this, will
you help Caroline?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will; soberly and seriously, I will. I'll drive over
there and have a little talk with the girl, as soon as you're
gone."</p>

<p>"And, uncle," said I, "if you wish to gain influence with
her, don't flatter nor compliment; examine her, and appoint
her tasks exactly as you would those of a young man in
similar circumstances. You will please her best so; she is
ready to do work, and make serious studies; she is of a thorough,
earnest nature, and will do credit to your teaching."</p>

<p>"What a pity she wasn't born a boy," said my uncle,
under his breath.</p>

<p>"Well, let you and me do what we can," said I, "to bring
in such a state of things in this world that it shall no longer
be said of any woman that it was a pity not to have been
born a man."</p>

<p>Subsequently I spoke to my mother on the same subject
and gave her an account of my interview with Caroline.</p>

<p>I think that my mother, in her own secret heart, had cherished
very much the same hopes for me that had been expressed
by Uncle Jacob. Caroline was an uncommon person,
the star of the little secluded neighborhood, and my mother
had seen enough of her to know that, though principally
absorbed in the requirements of a very hard domestic sphere
she possessed an uncommon character and great capabilities.
Between her and my mother, however, there had been
that silence which often exists between two natures, both
sensitive and both reticent, who seem to act as non-conductors
to each other. Caroline stood a little in awe of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
moral and religious force of my mother, and my mother
was a little chilled by the keen intellectualism of Caroline.</p>

<p>There are people that cannot understand each other
without an interpreter, and it is not unfrequently easier for
men and women to speak confidentially to each other than
to their own sex. There are certain aspects in which each
sex is sure of more comprehension than from its own. I
served, in this case, as the connecting wire of the galvanic
battery to pass the spark of sympathetic comprehension
between these two natures.</p>

<p>My mother was one of those women naturally timid, reticent,
retiring, encompassed by physical diffidence as with a
mantle&mdash;so sensitive that, even in an argument with me,
the blood would flush into her cheeks&mdash;yet, she had withal
that deep, brooding, philosophical nature, which revolves all
things silently, and with intensest interest, and comes to
perfectly independent conclusions in the irresponsible liberty
of solitude. How many times has this great noisy world
been looked out on, and silently judged by these quiet
thoughtful women of the Virgin Mary type, who have never
uttered their magnificat till they uttered it beyond the veil!
My mother seemed to be a woman in whom religious faith
had risen to that amount of certainty and security, that she
feared no kind of investigation or discussion, and had no
prejudices or passionate preferences. Thus she read the
works of the modern physical philosophical school with a
tranquil curiosity, and a patient analysis, apparently enjoying
every well-turned expression, and receiving with interest,
and weighing with deliberation every record of experiments,
and every investigation of facts. Her faith in her
religion was so perfect that she could afford all these explorations,
no more expecting her Christian hopes to fall,
through any discoveries of modern science, than she expected
the sun to cease shining on account of the contradictory
theories of astronomers. They who have lived in communion
with God have a mode of evidence unknown to philosophers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a knowledge at first hand. In the same manner,
the wideness of Christian charity gave my mother a most
Catholic tolerance for natures unlike her own.</p>

<p>"I have always believed in the doctrine of vocations," she
said, as she listened to me; "it is one of those points where
the Romish church has shown a superior good sense in discovering
and making a place for every kind of nature."</p>

<p>"Caroline has been afraid to confide in you, lest you should
think her struggles to rise above her destiny, and her dissatisfaction
with it, irreligious."</p>

<p>"Far from it," said my mother; "I wholly sympathize with
her; people don't realize what it is to starve faculties; they
understand physical starvation, but the slow fainting and
dying of desires and capabilities for want of anything to
feed upon, the withering of powers for want of exercise, is
what they do not understand. This is what Caroline is condemned
to, by the fixed will of her father, and whether any
mortal can prevail with him, I don't know."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> might, dear mother, I am sure."</p>

<p>"I doubt it; he has a manner that freezes me. I think
in his hard, silent, interior way, he loves me, but any argument
addressed to him, any direct attempt to change his
opinions and purpose only makes him harder."</p>

<p>"Would it not, then, be her right to choose her course
without his consent&mdash;and against it?" My mother sat with
her blue eyes looking thoughtfully before her.</p>

<p>"There is no point," she said slowly, "that requires more
careful handling, to discriminate right from wrong, than the
limits of self-sacrifice. To a certain extent it is a virtue,
and the noblest one, but there are rights of the individual
that ought not to be sacrificed; our own happiness has its
<em>just</em> place, and I cannot see it to be more right to suffer injustice
to one's self than to another, if one can help it. The
individual right of self-assertion of child against parent is
like the right of revolution in the State, a difficult one to
define, yet a real one. It seems to me that one owes it to
God, and to the world, to become all that one can be, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
do all that one can do, and that a blind, unreasoning authority
that forbids this is to be resisted by a higher law. If I
would help <em>another</em> person to escape from an unreasoning
tyranny, I ought to do as much for myself."</p>

<p>"And don't you think," said I, "that the silent self-abnegation
of some fine natures has done harm by increasing in
those around them the habits of tyranny and selfishness?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said my mother, "many wives make their
husbands bad Christians, and really stand in the way of their
salvation, by a weak, fond submission, and a sort of morbid
passion for self-sacrifice&mdash;really generous and noble men are
often tempted to fatal habits of selfishness in this way."</p>

<p>"Then would it not be better for Caroline to summon
courage to tell her father exactly how she feels and views
his course and hers?"</p>

<p>"He has a habit," said my mother, "of cutting short any
communication from his children that doesn't please him
by bringing down his hand abruptly and saying, 'No more
of that, I don't want to hear it.' With me he accomplishes
the same by abruptly leaving the room. The fact is," said
my mother, after a pause, "I more than suspect that he set
his foot on something really vital to Caroline's life, years ago,
when she was quite young."</p>

<p>"You mean an attachment?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I had hoped that it had been outgrown or superseded,
probably it may be, but I think she is one of the sort
in which such an experience often destroys all chance for
any other to come after it."</p>

<p>"Were you told of this?"</p>

<p>"I discovered it by an accident, no matter how. I was
not told, and I know very little, yet enough to enable me to
admire the vigor with which she has made the most of life,
the cheerfulness and thoroughness with which she has
accepted hard duties. Well," she added, after a pause, "I
will talk with Caroline, and we will see what can be done,
and then," she added, "we can carry the matter to a higher
One, who understands all, and holds all in his hands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>My mother spoke with a bright assured force of this
resort, sacred in every emergency.</p>

<p>This was the last night of my stay at home, the next day
I was to start for my ship to go to Europe. I sat up late writing
to Caroline, and left the letter in my mother's hands.</p>

<p class="ph3">I LAY THE FIRST STONE IN MY FOUNDATION.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My</span> story now opens in New York, whither I am come
to seek my fortune as a maker and seller of the
invisible fabrics of the brain.</p>

<p>During my year in Europe I had done my best to make myself
known at the workshops of different literary periodicals,
as a fabricator of these airy wares. I tried all sorts
and sizes of articles, from grave to gay, from lively to
severe, sowing them broadcast in various papers, without
regard to pecuniary profit, and the consequence was that
I came back to New York as a writer favorably known,
who had made something of a position. To be sure my
foot was on the lowest round of the ladder, but it was <em>on</em>
the ladder, and I meant to climb.</p>

<p>"To climb&mdash;to what?" In the answer a man gives to
that question lies the whole character of his life-work. If
to climb be merely to gain a name, and a competence, a
home, a wife, and children, with the means of keeping them
in ease and comfort, the question, though beset with difficulties
of practical performance, is comparatively simple.
But if in addition to this a man is to build himself up after
an ideal standard, as carefully as if he were a temple to
stand for eternity; if he is to lend a hand to help that great
living temple which God is perfecting in human society,
the question becomes more complicated still.</p>

<p>I fear some of my fair readers are by this time impatient
to see something of "my wife." Let me tell them for their
comfort that at this moment, when I entered New York on a
drizzly, lonesome December evening she was there, fair as a
star, though I knew it not. The same may be true of you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
young man. If you are ever to be married, your wife is
probably now in the world; some house holds her, and
there are mortal eyes at this hour to whom her lineaments
are as familiar as they are unknown to you. So much for
the doctrine of predestination.</p>

<p>But at this hour that I speak of, though the lady in question
was a living and blessed fact, and though she looked
on the same stars, and breathed the same air, and trod daily
the same sidewalk with myself, I was not, as I perceive, any
the wiser or better for it at this particular period of my existence.</p>

<p>In fact, though she was in a large part the unperceived
spring and motive of all that I did, yet at this particular
time I was so busy in adjusting the material foundations of
my life that the ideas of marrying and giving in marriage
were never less immediately in my thoughts. I came into
New York a stranger. I knew nobody personally, and I had
no time for visiting.</p>

<p>I had been, in the course of my wanderings, in many
cities. I had lingered in Paris, Rome, Florence, and Naples,
and, with the exception of London, I never found a place so
difficult to breathe the breath of any ideality, or any enthusiasm,
or exaltation of any description, as New York.
London, with its ponderous gloom, its sullen, mammoth,
aristocratic shadows, seems to benumb, and chill, and freeze
the soul; but New York impressed me like a great hot furnace,
where twig, spray, and flower wither in a moment,
and the little birds flying over, drop down dead. My first
impulse in life there was to cover, and conceal, and hide in
the deepest and most remote caverns of my heart anything
that was sacred, and delicate, and tender, lest the flame
should scorch it. Balzac in his epigrammatic manner has
characterized New York as the city where there is "neither
faith, hope, nor charity," and, as he never came here, I suppose
he must have taken his impressions from the descriptions
of unfortunate compatriots, who have landed strangers
and been precipitated into the very rush and whirl of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
grinding selfishness, and its desperate don't-care manner of
doing things. There is abundance of selfishness and hardness
in Paris, but it is concealed under a veil of ideality.
The city wooes you like a home, it gives you picture-galleries,
fountains, gardens, and grottoes, and a good natured
lounging population, who have nothing to do but make
themselves agreeable.</p>

<p>I must confess that my first emotion in making my way
about the streets of New York, before I had associated
them with any intimacy or acquaintances, was a vague
sort of terror, such as one would feel at being jostled
among cannibals, who on a reasonable provocation wouldn't
hesitate to skin him and pick his bones. There was such
a driving, merciless, fierce "take-care-of-yourself, and devil
take the hindmost" air, even to the drays and omnibuses,
and hackmen, that I had somewhat the feeling of being in
an unregulated menagerie, not knowing at what moment
some wild beast might spring upon me. As I became more
acquainted in the circles centering around the different
publications, I felt an acrid, eager, nipping air, in which it
appeared to me that everybody had put on defensive armor
in regard to his own innermost and most precious feelings,
and like the lobster, armed himself with claws to seize and
to tear that which came in his way. The rivalry between
great literary organs was so intense, and the competition so
vivid, that the offering of any flower of fancy or feeling to
any of them, seemed about as absurd as if a man should
offer a tea-rose bud to the bawling, shouting hackman that
shake their whips and scream at the landing.</p>

<p>Everything in life and death, and time and eternity,
whether high as Heaven, or deep as hell, seemed to be
looked upon only as subject matter for advertisement, and
material for running a paper. Hand out your wares!
advertise them and see what they will bring, seemed to
be the only law of production, at whose behest the most
delicate webs and traceries of fancy, the most solemn and
tender mysteries of feeling, the most awful of religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
emotions came to have a trademark and market value! In
short, New York is the great business mart, the Vanity
Fair of the world, where everything is pushed by advertising
and competition, not even excepting the great moral
enterprise of bringing in the millennium; and in the first
blast and blare of its busy, noisy publicity and activity, I
felt my inner spirits shrink and tremble with dismay.
Even the religion of this modern century bears the deep
impress of the trade-mark, which calendars its financial
value.</p>

<p>I could not but think what the sweet and retiring Galilean,
who in the old days was weary and worn with the
rush of crowds in simple old Palestine, must think if he
looks down now, on the way in which his religion is advertised
and pushed in modern society. Certain it is, if it be
the kingdom of God that is coming in our times, it is coming
with very great observation, and people have long since forgot
the idea that they are not to say "Lo, here!" and "Lo,
there!" since that is precisely what a large part of the
world are getting their living by doing.</p>

<p>These ideas I must confess bore with great weight on
my mind, as I had just parted from my mother, whose last
words were that whatever else I did, and whether I gained
anything for this life or not, she trusted that I would live
an humble, self-denying, Christian life. I must own that
for the first few weeks of looking into the interior management
of literary life in New York, the idea at times often
seemed to me really ludicrous. To be humble, yet to seek
success in society where it is the first duty to crow from
morning till night, and to praise, and vaunt, and glorify, at
the top of one's lungs, one's own party, or paper, or magazine,
seemed to me sufficiently amusing. However, in conformity
with a solemn promise made to my mother, I lost
no time in uniting myself with a Christian body, of my
father's own denomination, and presented a letter from the
Church in Highland to the brethren of the Bethany Church.</p>

<p>And here I will say that for a young man who wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
shelter, and nourishment and shade for the development of
his fine moral sensibilities, a breakwater to keep the waves
of materialism from dashing over and drowning his higher
life, there is nothing better, as yet to be found, than a union
with some one of the many bodies of differing names and
denominations calling themselves Christian Churches. A
Christian Church, according to the very best definition of
the name ever yet given, is a congregation of faithful men
in which the pure word of God is preached, and the sacraments
duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance; and
making due allowance for all the ignorance, and prejudice,
and mistakes, and even the willful hypocrisy, which, as
human nature is, must always exist in such connections, I
must say that I think these Churches are the best form of
social moral culture yet invented, and not to be dispensed
with till something more fully answering the purpose has
been tested for as long a time as they.</p>

<p>These are caravans that cross the hot and weary sands of
life, and while there may be wrangling and undesirable
administration at times within them, yet, after all, the pilgrim
that undertakes alone is but a speck in the wide desert,
too often blown away, and withering like the leaf before the
wind.</p>

<p>The great congregation of the Bethany on Sabbath days,
all standing up together and joining in mighty hymn-singing,
though all were outwardly unknown to me, seemed to
thrill my heart with a sense of solemn companionship, in
my earliest and most sacred religious associations. It was
a congregation largely made up of young men, who like
myself were strangers, away from home and friends, and
whose hearts, touched and warmed by the familiar sounds,
seemed to send forth magnetic odors like the interlocked
pine trees under the warm sunshine of a June day.</p>

<p>I have long felt that he who would work his brain for
a living, without premature wear upon the organ, must have
Sunday placed as a sacred barrier of entire oblivion, so far
as possible, of the course of his week-day cares. And what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
oblivion can be more complete than to rise on the wings of
religious ordinance into the region of those diviner faculties
by which man recognizes his heirship to all that is in God?</p>

<p>In like manner I found an oasis in the hot and hurried
course of my week-day life, by dropping in to the weekly
prayer-meeting. The large, bright, pleasant room seemed
so social and home-like, the rows of cheerful, well-dressed,
thoughtful people, seemed, even before I knew one of them,
fatherly, motherly, brotherly, and sisterly, as they joined
with the piano in familiar hymn-singing, while the pastor
sat among them as a father in his family, and easy social
conversation went on with regard to the various methods
and aspects of the practical religious life.</p>

<p>To me, a stranger, and naturally shy and undemonstrative,
this socialism was in the highest degree warming and
inspiring. I do not mean to set the praise of this Church
above that of a hundred others, with which I might have
become connected, but I will say that here I met the types
of some of those good old-fashioned Christians that Hawthorne
celebrates in his "Celestial Railroad," under the
name of Messrs. "Stick to the Right," and "Foot it to
Heaven," men better known among the poor and afflicted
than in fashionable or literary circles, men who, without
troubling their heads about much speculation, are footing
it to Heaven on the old, time-worn, narrow way, and carrying
with them as many as they can induce to go.</p>

<p>Having thus provided against being drawn down and
utterly swamped in the bread-and-subsistence struggle that
was before me, I sought to gain a position in connection
with some paper in New York. I had offers under consideration
from several of them. The conductors of "<cite>The
Moral Spouting Horn</cite>" had conversed with me touching
their projects, and I had also been furnishing letters for the
"<cite>Great Democracy</cite>," and one of the proprietors had invited
me to a private dinner, I suppose for the purpose of
looking me over and trying my paces before he concluded
to purchase me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Goldstick was a florid, middle-aged man, with a
slightly bald head, an easy portliness of manner, and that
air of comfortable patronage which men who are up in
the world sometimes carry towards young aspirants. It
was his policy and his way to put himself at once on a footing
of equality with them, easy, jolly, and free; justly
thinking that thereby he gained a more unguarded insight
into the inner citadel of their nature, and could see in the
easy play of their faculties just about how much they could
be made to answer his purposes. I had a chatty, merry dinner
of it, and found all my native shyness melting away
under his charming affability. In fact, during the latter
part of the time, I almost felt that I could have told him
anything that I could have told my own mother. What
did we not talk about that is of interest in these stirring
times? Philosophy, history, science, religion, life, death,
and immortality&mdash;all received the most graceful off-hand
treatment, and were discussed with a singular unanimity
of sentiment&mdash;that unanimity which always takes place
when the partner in a discussion has the controlling purpose
to be of the same mind as yourself. When, under the warm
and sunny air of this genial nature, I had fully expanded,
and confidence was in full blossom, came the immediate
business conversation in relation to the paper.</p>

<p>"I am rejoiced," said Mr. Goldstick, "in these days of
skepticism to come across a young man with real religious
convictions. I am not, I regret to say, a religious professor
myself, but I appreciate it, Mr. Henderson, as the element
most wanting in our modern life."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Goldstick sighed and rolled up his eyes, and took
a glass of wine.</p>

<p>I felt encouraged in this sympathetic atmosphere to unfold
to him my somewhat idealized views of what might be
accomplished by the daily press, by editors as truly under
moral vows and consecrations, as the clergymen who ministered
at the altar.</p>

<p>He caught the idea from me with enthusiasm, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
on to expand it with a vigor and richness of imagery, and to
illustrate it with a profusion of incidents, which left me far
behind him, gazing after him with reverential admiration.</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson," said he, "<cite>The Great Democracy</cite> is not
primarily a money-making enterprise&mdash;it is a great moral
engine; it is for the great American people, and it contemplates
results which look to the complete regeneration of
society."</p>

<p>I ventured here to remark that the same object had been
stated to me by the <cite>Moral Spouting Horn</cite>.</p>

<p>His countenance assumed at once an expression of intense
disgust.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," he said, "that the charlatan has been trying
to get hold of you? My dear fellow," he added, drawing
near to me with a confidential air, "of course I would
be the last man to infringe on the courtesies due to my
brethren of the press, and you must be aware that our present
conversation is to be considered strictly confidential."</p>

<p>I assured him with fervor that I should consider it so.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said, "between ourselves, I may say that
<cite>The Moral Spouting Horn</cite> is a humbug. On mature reflection,"
he added, "I don't know but duty requires me to go
farther, and say, in the strictest confidence, you understand,
that I consider <cite>The Moral Spouting Horn</cite> a swindle."</p>

<p>Here it occurred to me that the same communication had
been made in equal confidence, by the proprietor of <cite>The
Moral Spouting Horn</cite> in relation to <cite>The Great Democracy</cite>.
But, much as I was warmed into confidence by the genial
atmosphere of my friend, I had still enough prudence to
forbear making this statement.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "my young friend, in devoting yourself
to the service of <cite>The Great Democracy</cite> you may consider
yourself as serving the cause of God and mankind in ways
that no clergyman has an equal chance of doing. Beside
the press, sir, the pulpit is effete. It is, so to speak," he
added, with a sweep of the right hand, "nowhere. Of course
the responsibilities of conducting such an organ are tremendous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
tremendous," he added, reflectively, as I looked
at him with awe; "and that is why I require in my writers,
above all things, the clearest and firmest moral convictions.
Sir, it is a critical period in our history; there is an amount
of corruption in this nation that threatens its dissolution;
the Church and the Pulpit have proved entirely inadequate
to stem it. It rests with the Press."</p>

<p>There was a solemn pause, in which nothing was heard but
the clink of the decanter on the glass, as he poured out
another glass of wine.</p>

<p>"It is a great responsibility," I remarked, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Enormous!" he added, with almost a groan, eyeing me
sternly. "Consider," he went on, "the evils of the tremendously
corrupted literature which is now being poured
upon the community. Sir, we are fast drifting to destruction,
it is a solemn fact. The public mind must be aroused
and strengthened to resist; they must be taught to discriminate;
there must be a just standard of moral criticism
no less than of intellectual, and that must be attended to
in our paper."</p>

<p>I was delighted to find his views in such accordance with
my own, and assured him I should be only too happy to do
what I could to forward them.</p>

<p>"We have been charmed and delighted," he said, "with
your contributions hitherto; they have a high moral tone
and have been deservedly popular, and it is our desire to
secure you as a stated contributor in a semi-editorial capacity,
looking towards future developments. We wish that
it were in our power to pay a more liberal sum than we can
offer, but you must be aware, Mr. Henderson, that great
moral enterprises must always depend, in a certain degree,
on the element of self-sacrifice in its promoters."</p>

<p>I reflected, at this moment, on my father's life, and assented
with enthusiasm&mdash;remarking that "if I could only get
enough to furnish me with the necessaries of life I should
be delighted to go into the glorious work with him, and
give to it the whole enthusiasm of my soul."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have the right spirit, young man," he said. "It is
delightful to witness this freshness of moral feeling." And
thus, before our interview was closed, I had signed a contract
of service to Mr. Goldstick, at very moderate wages,
but my heart was filled with exulting joy at the idea of the
possibilities of the situation.</p>

<p>I was young, and ardent; I did <em>not</em>, at this moment, want
to make money so much as to make myself felt in the
great world. It was the very spirit of Phæton; I wanted
to have a hand on the reins, and a touch of the whip, and
guide the fiery horses of Progress.</p>

<p>I had written stories, and sung songs, but I was not quite
content with those; I wanted the anonymous pulpit of the
Editor to speak in, the opportunity of being the daily invisible
companion and counselor of thousands about their
daily paths. The offer of Mr. Goldstick, as I understood it,
looked that way, and I resolved to deserve so well of
him by unlimited devotion to the interests of the paper,
that he should open my way before me.</p>

<p class="ph3">BACHELOR COMRADES.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I</span> soon became well acquainted with my collaborators
on the paper. It was a pleasant surprise to
be greeted in the foreground by the familiar face
of Jim Fellows, my old college class-mate.</p>

<p>Jim was an agreeable creature, born with a decided genius
for gossip. He had in perfection the faculty which phrenologists
call individuality. He was statistical in the very
marrow of his bones, apparently imbibing all the external
facts of every person and everything around him, by a kind
of rapid instinct. In college, Jim always knew all about
every student; he knew all about everybody in the little
town where the college was situated, their name, history,
character, business, their front door and their back door
affairs. No birth, marriage, or death ever took Jim by surprise;
he always knew all about it long ago.</p>

<p>Now, as a newspaper is a gossip market on a large scale,
this species of talent often goes farther in our modern literary
life than the deepest reflection or the highest culture.</p>

<p>Jim was the best-natured fellow breathing; it was impossible
to ruffle or disturb the easy, rattling, chattering
flow of his animal spirits. He was like a Frenchman in his
power of bright, airy adaptation to circumstances, and determination
and ability to make the most of them.</p>

<p>"How lucky!" he said, the morning I first shook hands
with him at the office of the <cite>Great Democracy</cite>; "you are
just on the minute; the very lodging you want has been
vacated this morning by old Styles; sunny room&mdash;south
windows&mdash;close by here&mdash;water, gas, and so on, all correct;
and, best of all, <em>me</em> for your opposite neighbor."</p>

<p>I went round with him, looked, approved, and was settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
at once, Jim helping me with all the good-natured handiness
and activity of old college days. We had a rattling,
gay morning, plunging round into auction-rooms, bargaining
for second-hand furniture, and with so much zeal did
we drive our enterprise, seconded by the co-labors of a
whom Jim patronized, that by night I found myself
actually settled in a home of my own, making tea in Jim's
patent bachelor tea-kettle, and talking over his and my
affairs with the freedom of old cronies. Jim made no scruple
in inquiring in the most direct manner as to the terms
of my agreement with Mr. Goldstick, and opened the subject
succinctly, as follows:</p>

<p>"Now, my son, you must let your old grandfather advise
you a little about your temporalities. In the first
place; what's Old Soapy going to give you?"</p>

<p>"If you mean Mr. Goldstick," said I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "call him 'Soapy' for short. Did he
come down handsomely on the terms?"</p>

<p>"His offers were not as large as I should have liked; but
then, as he said, this paper is not a money-making affair,
but a moral enterprise, and I am willing to work for less."</p>

<p>"Moral grandmother!" said Jim, in a tone of unlimited
disgust. "He be&mdash;choked, as it were. Why, Harry Henderson,
are your eye-teeth in such a retrograde state as that?
Why, this paper is a fortune to that man; he lives in a
palace, owns a picture gallery, and rolls about in his own
carriage."</p>

<p>"I understood him," said I, "that the paper was not
immediately profitable in a pecuniary point of view."</p>

<p>"Soapy calls everything unprofitable that does not yield
him fifty per cent. on the money invested. Talk of moral
enterprise! What did he engage you for?"</p>

<p>I stated the terms.</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"For one year."</p>

<p>"Well, the best you can do is to work it out now. Never
make another bargain without asking your grandfather.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Why, he pays me just double; and you know, Harry, I
am nothing at all of a writer compared to you. But then,
to be sure, I fill a place you've really no talent for."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"General professor of humbug," said Jim. "No sort of
business gets on in this world without that, and I'm a real
genius in that line. I made Old Soapy come down, by
threatening to 'rat,' and go to the <cite>Spouting Horn</cite>, and they
couldn't afford to let me do that. You see, I've been up
their back stairs, and know all their little family secrets.
The <cite>Spouting Horn</cite> would give their eye-teeth for me. It's
too funny," he said, throwing himself back and laughing.</p>

<p>"Are these papers rivals?" said I.</p>

<p>"Well, I should 'rayther' think they were," said he, eyeing
me with an air of superiority amounting almost to contempt.
"Why, man, the thing that I'm particularly valuable for is,
that I always know just what will plague the <cite>Spouting
Horn</cite> folks the most. I know precisely where to stick a pin
or a needle into them; and one great object of our paper is
to show that the <cite>Spouting Horn</cite> is always in the wrong.
No matter what topic is uppermost, I attend to that, and
get off something on them. For you see, they are popular,
and make money like thunder, and, of course, that isn't to
be allowed. Now," he added, pointing with his thumb upward,
"overhead, there is really our best fellow&mdash;Bolton.
Bolton is said to be the best writer of English in our
day; he's an A No. 1, and no mistake; tremendously educated,
and all that, and he knows exactly to a shaving what's
what everywhere; he's a gentleman, too; we call him the
Dominie. Well, Bolton writes the great leaders, and fires
off on all the awful and solemn topics, and lays off the politics
of Europe and the world generally. When there's a
row over there in Europe, Bolton is magnificent on editorials.
You see, he has the run of all the rows they have had
there, and every bobbery that has been kicked up since the
Christian era. He'll tell you what the French did in 1700<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
this, and the Germans in 1800 that, and of course he prophesies
splendidly on what's to turn up next."</p>

<p>"I suppose they give him large pay," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Bolton's a quiet fellow and a gentleman&mdash;one
that hates to jaw&mdash;and is modest, and so they keep him
along steady on about half what <em>I</em> would get out of them
if I were in his skin. Bolton is perfectly satisfied. If I
were he, I shouldn't be, you see. I say, Harry, I know
you'd like him. Let me bring him down and introduce
him," and before I could either consent or refuse, Jim rattled
up stairs, and I heard him in an earnest, persuasive
treaty, and soon he came down with his captive.</p>

<p>I saw a man of thirty-three or thereabouts, tall, well
formed, with bright, dark eyes, strongly-marked features,
a finely-turned head, and closely-cropped black hair. He
had what I should call <em>presence</em>&mdash;something that impressed
me, as he entered the room, with the idea of a superior kind
of individuality, though he was simple in his manners,
with a slight air of shyness and constraint. The blood
flushed in his cheeks as he was introduced to me, and there
was a tremulous motion about his finely-cut lips, betokening
suppressed sensitiveness. The first sound of his voice, as he
spoke, struck on my ear agreeably, like the tones of a fine
instrument, and, reticent and retiring as he seemed, I felt
myself singularly attracted toward him.</p>

<p>What impressed me most, as he joined in the conversation
with my rattling, free and easy, good-natured neighbor,
was an air of patient, amused tolerance. He struck me as
a man who had made up his mind to expect nothing and ask
nothing of life, and who was sitting it out patiently, as one
sits out a dull play at the theater. He was disappointed
with nobody, and angry with nobody, while he seemed to
have no confidence in anybody. With all this apparent
reserve, he was simply and frankly cordial to me, as a new-comer
and a fellow-worker on the same paper.</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson," he said, "I shall be glad to extend to
you the hospitalities of my den, such as they are. If I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
at any time render you any assistance, don't hesitate to use
me. Perhaps you would like to walk up and look at my
books? I shall be only too happy to put them at your disposal."</p>

<p>We went up into a little attic room whose walls were literally
lined with books on all sides, only allowing space for
the two southerly windows which overlooked the city.</p>

<p>"I like to be high in the world, you see," he said, with a
smile.</p>

<p>The room was not a large one, and the center was occupied
by a large table, covered with books and papers. A cheerful
coal-fire was burning in the little grate, a large leather arm-chair
stood before it, and, with one or two other chairs,
completed the furniture of the apartment. A small, lighted
closet, whose door stood open on the room, displayed a pallet
bed of monastic simplicity.</p>

<p>There were two occupants of the apartment who seemed
established there by right of possession. A large Maltese
cat, with great, golden eyes, like two full moons, sat gravely
looking into the fire, in one corner, and a very plebeian,
scrubby mongrel, who appeared to have known the hard
side of life in former days, was dozing in the other.</p>

<p>Apparently, these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genii loci</i> were so strong in their sense
of possession that our entrance gave them no disturbance.
The dog unclosed his eyes with a sleepy wink as we came
in, and then shut them again, dreamily, as satisfied that all
was right.</p>

<p>Bolton invited us to sit down, and did the honors of his
room with a quiet elegance, as if it had been a palace instead
of an attic. As soon as we were seated, the cat sprang
familiarly on the table and sat down cosily by Bolton, rubbing
her head against his coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce you to my wife," said Bolton, stroking
her head. "Eh, Jenny, what now?" he added, as she seized
his hands playfully in her teeth and claws. "You see, she
has the connubial weapons," he said, "and insists on being
treated with attention; but she's capital company. I read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
all my articles to her, and she never makes an unjust criticism."</p>

<p>Puss soon stepped from her perch on the table and ensconced
herself in his lap, while I went round examining
his books.</p>

<p>The library showed varied and curious tastes. The books
were almost all rare.</p>

<p>"I have always made a rule," he said, "never to buy a
book that I could borrow."</p>

<p>I was amused, in the course of the conversation, at the
relations which apparently existed between him and Jim
Fellows, which appeared to me to be very like what might
be supposed to exist between a philosopher and a lively
pet squirrel&mdash;it was the perfection of quiet, amused tolerance.</p>

<p>Jim seemed to be not in the slightest degree under constraint
in his presence, and rattled on with a free and easy
slang familiarity, precisely as he had done with me.</p>

<p>"What do you think Old Soapy has engaged Hal for?"
he said. "Why, he only offers him&mdash;" Here followed the
statement of terms.</p>

<p>I was annoyed at this matter-of-fact way of handling
my private affairs, but on meeting the eyes of my new
friend I discerned a glance of quiet humor which re-assured
me. He seemed to regard Jim only as another form of the
inevitable.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is a confounded take-in?" said Jim.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mr. Bolton, with a smile, "but he will
survive it. The place is only one of the stepping-stones.
Meanwhile," he said, "I think Mr. Henderson can find other
markets for his literary wares, and more profitable ones.
I think," he added, while the blood again rose in his cheeks,
"that I have some influence in certain literary quarters,
and I shall be happy to do all that I can to secure to him
that which he ought to receive for such careful work as
this. Your labor on the paper will not by any means take
up your whole power or time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Jim, "the fact is the same all the world over&mdash;the
people that grow a thing are those that get the
least for it. It isn't your farmers, that work early and late,
that get rich by what they raise out of the earth, it's the
middlemen and the hucksters. And just so it is in literature;
and the better a fellow writes, and the more work he
puts into it, the less he gets paid for it. Why, now, look
at me," he said, perching himself astride the arm of a
chair, "I'm a genuine literary humbug, but I'll bet you
I'll make more money than either of you, because, you see,
I've no modesty and no conscience. Confound it all, those
are luxuries that a poor fellow can't afford to keep. I'm
a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal, but I'm just the sort
of fellow the world wants, and, hang it, they shall pay
me for being that sort of fellow. I mean to make it shell
out, and you see if I don't. I'll bet you, now, that I'd write
a book that you wouldn't, either of you, be hired to write,
and sell one hundred thousand copies of it, and put the
money in my pocket, marry the handsomest, richest, and
best educated girl in New York, while you are trudging on,
doing good, careful work, as you call it."</p>

<p>"Remember us in your will," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I will," he said. "I'll found an asylum for decayed
authors of merit&mdash;a sort of literary 'Hotel des Invalides.'"</p>

<p>We had a hearty laugh over this idea, and, on the whole,
our evening passed off very merrily. When I shook hands
with Bolton for the night, it was with a silent conviction of
an interior affinity between us.</p>

<p>It is a charming thing in one's rambles to come across a
tree, or a flower, or a fine bit of landscape that one can
think of afterward, and feel richer for their its in the
world. But it is more when one is in a strange place, to
come across a man that you feel thoroughly persuaded is,
somehow or other, morally and intellectually worth exploring.
Our lives tend to become so hopelessly commonplace,
and the human beings we meet are generally so much one
just like another, that the possibility of a new and peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
style of character in an acquaintance is a most enlivening
one.</p>

<p>There was something about Bolton both stimulating and
winning, and I lay down less a stranger that night than I
had been since I came to New York.</p>

<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" />
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I</span> entered upon my new duties with enthusiasm,
and produced some editorials, for which I was
complimented by Mr. Goldstick.</p>

<p>"That's the kind of thing wanted!" he said; "a firm, moral
tone, and steady religious convictions; that pleases the old
standards."</p>

<p>Emboldened by this I proceeded to attack a specific abuse
in New York administration, which had struck me as needing
to be at once righted. If ever a moral trumpet ought to have
its voice, it was on this subject. I read my article to Bolton;
in fact I had gradually fallen into the habit of referring myself
to his judgment.</p>

<p>"It is all perfectly true," he remarked, when I had finished,
while he leaned back in his chair and stroked his cat,
"but they never will put <em>that</em> into the paper, in the world."</p>

<p>"Why!" said I, "if ever there was an abuse that required
exposing, it is this."</p>

<p>"Precisely!" he replied.</p>

<p>"And what is the use," I went on, "of general moral
preaching that is never applied to any particular case?"</p>

<p>"The use," he replied calmly, "is that that kind of preaching
pleases everybody, and increases subscribers, while the
other kind makes enemies, and decreases them."</p>

<p>"And you really think that they won't put this article in?"
said I.</p>

<p>"I'm certain they won't," he replied. "The fact is this paper
is bought up on the other side. Messrs. Goldstick and Co.
have intimate connection with Messrs. Bunkam and Chaffem,
who are part and parcel of this very affair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>I opened my mouth with astonishment. "Then Goldstick
is a hypocrite," I said.</p>

<p>"Not consciously," he answered, calmly.</p>

<p>"Why!" said I, "you would have thought by the way he
talked to me that he had nothing so much at heart as the
moral progress of society, and was ready to sacrifice everything
to it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bolton, quietly, "did you never see a woman
who thought she was handsome, when she was not? Did
you never see a man who thought he was witty, when he
was only scurrilous and impudent? Did you never see people
who flattered themselves they were frank, because they
were obtuse and impertinent? And cannot you imagine
that a man may think himself a philanthropist, when he is
only a worshiper of the golden calf? That same calf," he
continued, stroking his cat till she purred aloud, "has the
largest Church of any on earth."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "at any rate I'll hand it in."</p>

<p>"You can do so," he replied, "and that will be the last
you will hear of it. You see, I've been this way before you,
and I have learned to save myself time and trouble on these
subjects."</p>

<p>The result was precisely as Bolton predicted.</p>

<p>"We must be a little careful, my young friend," said Mr.
Goldstick, "how we handle specific matters of this kind;
they have extended relations that a young man cannot be
expected to appreciate, and I would advise you to confine
yourself to abstract moral principles; keep up a high moral
standard, sir, and things will come right of themselves.
Now, sir, if you could expose the corruptions in England it
would have an admirable moral effect, and our general line
of policy now is down on England."</p>

<p>A day or two after, however, I fell into serious disgrace.
A part of my duties consisted in reviewing the current literature
of the day; Bolton, Jim, and I, took that department
among us, and I soon learned to sympathize with the tea-tasters,
who are said to ruin their digestion by an incessant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
tasting of the different qualities of tea. The enormous
quantity and variety of magazines and books that I had to
"sample" in a few days brought me into such a state of
mental dyspepsia, that I began to wish every book in the
Red Sea. I really was brought to consider the usual pleas
and tone of book notices in America to be evidence of a
high degree of Christian forbearance. In looking over my
share, however, I fell upon a novel of the modern, hot, sensuous
school, in which glowing coloring and a sort of religious
sentimentalism were thrown around actions and principles
which tended directly to the dissolution of society.
Here was exactly the opportunity to stem that tide of corruption
against which Mr. Goldstick so solemnly had warned
me. I made the analysis of the book a text for exposing
the whole class of principles and practices it inculcated, and
uttering my warning against corrupt literature; I sent it
to the paper, and in it went. A day or two after Mr. Goldstick
came into the office in great disorder, with an open
letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" he said; "here's Sillery and Peacham,
blowing us up for being down on their books, and threatening
to take away their advertising from us."</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to know anything about it, till finally the
matter was traced back to me.</p>

<p>"It was a corrupt book, Mr. Goldstick," said I, with
firmness, "and the very object you stated to me was to
establish a just moral criticism."</p>

<p>"Go to thunder! young man," said Mr. Goldstick, in a
tone I had never heard before. "Have you no discrimination?
are you going to blow us up? The <cite>Great Democracy</cite>,
sir, is a great moral engine, and the advertising of this
publishing house gives thousands of dollars yearly towards
its support. It's an understood thing that Sillery and
Peacham's books are to be treated handsomely."</p>

<p>"I say, Captain," said Jim, who came up behind us at this
time, "let me manage this matter; I'll straighten it out; Sillery
and Peacham know me, and I'll fix it with them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come! Hal, my boy!" he said, hooking me by the arm,
and leading me out.</p>

<p>We walked to our lodgings together. I was gloriously
indignant all the way, but Jim laughed till the tears rolled
down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"You sweet babe of Eden," said he, as we entered my
room, "do get quiet! I'll sit right down and write a letter
from the Boston correspondent on that book, saying that
your article has created a most immense sensation in the
literary circles of Boston, in regard to its moral character,
and exhort everybody to rush to the book-store and see for
themselves. Now, 'hush, my dear, lie still and slumber,'
while I do it."</p>

<p>"Why, do you mean to go to Boston?" said I.</p>

<p>"Only in spirit, my dear. Bless you! did you suppose
that the Boston correspondents, or any other correspondents,
are there, or anywhere else in fact, that they profess to be?
I told you that I was the professor of humbug. This little
affair lies strictly in my department."</p>

<p>"Jim!" said I, solemnly, "I don't want to be in such a
network of chicanery."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Hal, nobody else wants to be just where they
are, and after all, it's none of your business; you and Bolton
are great moral forty-pounders. When we get you pointed
the right way for the paper you can roar and fire away at
your leisure, and the moral effect will be prodigious. I'm
your flying-artillery&mdash;all over the field everywhere, pop, and
off again; and what is it to you what I do? Now you see,
Hal, you must just have some general lines about your
work; the fact is, I ought to have told you before. There's
Sillery and Peacham's books have got to be put straight
along: you see there is no mistake about that; and when you
and Bolton find one you can't praise honestly, turn it over
to me. Then, again, there's Burill and Bangem's books
have got to be put down. They had a row with us last
year, and turned over their advertising to the <cite>Spouting
Horn</cite>. Now, if you happen to find a bad novel among <em>their</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
books show it up, cut into it without mercy; it will give you
just as good a chance to preach, with your muzzle pointed
the right way, and do exactly as much good. You see there's
everything with you fellows in getting you pointed right."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "Jim, this course is utterly subversive of
all just criticism. It makes book notices good for nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, they are not good for much," said Jim reflectively.
"I sometimes pity a poor devil whose first book has
been all cut up, just because Goldstick's had a row with his
publishers. But then there's this comfort&mdash;what we run
down, the <cite>Spouting Horn</cite> will run up, so it is about as broad
as it is long. Then there's our Magazines. We're in with
the <cite>Rocky Mountains</cite> now&mdash;we've been out with them for
a year or two and cut up all their articles. Now you see we
are in, and the rule is, to begin at the beginning and praise
them all straight through, so you'll have plain sailing there.
Then there's the <cite>Pacific</cite>&mdash;you are to pick on that all you
can. I think you had better leave that to me. I have a
talent for saying little provoking things that gall people,
and that they can't answer. The fact is, the <cite>Pacific</cite> has got
to come down a little, and come to our terms, before we are
civil to it."</p>

<p>"Jim Fellows"&mdash;I began,</p>

<p>"Come, come, go and let off to Bolton, if you have got
anything more to say;" he added, "I want to write my
Boston letter. You see, Hal, I shall bring you out with
flying colors, and get a better sale for the book than if you
hadn't written."</p>

<p>"Jim," said I, "I'm going to get out of this paper."</p>

<p>"And pray, my dear Sir, what will you get into?"</p>

<p>"I'll get into one of the religious papers."</p>

<p>Jim upon this leaned back, kicked up his heels, and
laughed aloud. "I could help you there," he said. "I do
the literary for three religious newspapers now. These
solemn old Dons are so busy about their tweedle-dums and
tweedle-dees of justification and election, baptism and
church government, that they don't know anything about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
current literature, and get us fellows to write their book
notices. I rather think that they'd stare if they should read
some of the books that we puff up. I tell you, Christy's
Minstrels are nothing to it. Think of it, Hal,&mdash;the solemn
<cite>Holy Sentinel</cite> with a laudatory criticism of Dante Rosetti's
"Jenny" in it&mdash;and the <cite>Trumpet of Zion</cite> with a commendatory
notice of Georges Sand's novels." Here Jim laughed
with a fresh impulse. "You see the dear, good souls are
altogether too pious to know anything about it, and so we
liberalize the papers, and the publishers make us a little
consideration for getting their books started in religious
circles."</p>

<p>"Well, Jim," said I, "I want to just ask you, do you think
this sort of thing is right?"</p>

<p>"Bless your soul now!" said Jim, "if you are going to
begin with that, here in New York, where are you going to
end&mdash;'Where do you 'spect to die when you go to?'&mdash;as the
old darkey said."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "would you like to have Dante Rosetti's
"<cite>Jenny</cite>" put into the hands of <em>your</em> sister or younger brother,
recommended by a religious newspaper?"</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth, Hal, I didn't write those notices.
Bill Jones wrote them. Bill's up to anything. You know
every person in England and this country have praised
Dante Rosetti, and particularly "Jenny," and religious papers
may as well be out of the world as out of fashion,&mdash;and so
mother she bought a copy for a Christmas present to sister
Nell. And I tell you if I didn't get a going over about it!"</p>

<p>"I showed her the article in the <cite>Holy Sentinel</cite>, but it didn't
do a bit of good. She made me promise I wouldn't write it
up, and I never have. She said it was a shame. You see
mother isn't up to the talk about high art, that's got up
now a days about Dante Rosetti and Swinburne, and those.
I thought myself that "Jenny" was coming it pretty strong,&mdash;and
honest now, I never could see the sense in it. But then
you see I am not artistic. If a fellow should tell a story of
that kind to my sister, I should horsewhip him, and kick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
him down the front steps. But he dresses it up in poetry,
and it lies around on pious people's tables, and nobody dares
to say a word because it's "artistic." People are so afraid
they shall not be supposed to understand what high art is,
that they'll knuckle down under most anything. That's the
kind of world we live in. Well! I didn't make the world
and I don't govern it. But the world owes me a living, and
hang it! it shall give me one. So you go up to Bolton, and
leave me to do my work; I've got to write columns, and then
tramp out to that confounded water-color exhibition, because
I promised Snooks a puff,&mdash;I shan't get to bed till
twelve or one. I tell you it's steep on a fellow now."</p>

<p>I went up to Bolton, boiling, and bubbling and seething,
with the spirit of sixteen reformers in my veins. The
scene, as I opened the door, was sufficiently tranquilizing.
Bolton sat reading by the side of his shaded study-lamp,
with his cat asleep in his lap; the ill-favored dog, before
mentioned, was planted by his side, with his nose upturned,
surveying him with a fullness of doggish adoration and
complacency, which made his rubbishly shop-worn figure
quite an affecting item in the picture. Crouched down on
the floor in the corner, was a ragged, unkempt, freckled-faced
little boy, busy doing a sum on a slate.</p>

<p>"Ah! old fellow," he said, as he looked up and saw me.
"Come in; there, there, Snubby," he said to the dog, pushing
him gently into his corner; "let the gentleman sit down.
You see you find me surrounded by my family," he said.
"Wait one minute," he added, turning to the boy in the
corner, and taking his slate out of his hand, and running
over the sum. "All right, Bill. Now here's your book."
He took a volume of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> from the table, and
handed it to him, and Bill settled himself on the floor, and
was soon lost in "Sinbad the Sailor." He watched him a
minute or two, and then looked round at me, with a smile.
"I wouldn't be afraid to bet that you might shout in that
fellow's ear and he wouldn't hear you, now he is fairly in
upon that book. Isn't it worth while to be able to give such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
perfect bliss in this world at so small an expense? I've lost
the power of reading the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, but I comfort my
self in seeing this chap."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's my washerwoman's boy. Poor fellow. He has
hard times. I've set him up in selling newspapers. You
see, I try now and then to pick up one grain out of the heap
of misery, and put it into the heap of happiness, as John
Newton said."</p>

<p>I was still bubbling with the unrest of my spirit, and
finally overflowed upon him with the whole history of my
day's misadventures, and all the troubled thoughts and
burning indignations that I had with reference to it.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he said, "take it easy. We have to
accept this world as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>. It takes some time
for us to learn how little we can do to help or to hinder.
You cannot take a step in the business of life anywhere
without meeting just this kind of thing; and one part of
the science of living is to learn just what our own responsibility
is, and to let other people's alone. The fact is," he
said, "the growth of current literature in our times has
been so sudden and so enormous that things are in a
sort of revolutionary state with regard to it, in which it
is very difficult to ascertain the exact right. For example,
I am connected with a paper which is simply and purely, at
bottom, a financial speculation; its owners must make
money. Now, they are not bad men as the world goes&mdash;they
are well-meaning men&mdash;amiable, patriotic, philanthropic&mdash;some
of them are religious; they, all of them,
would rather virtue would prevail than vice, and good
than evil; they, all of them, would desire every kind of
abuse to be reformed, and every good cause to be forwarded,
that could be forwarded without a sacrifice of their
main object. As for me, I am not a holder or proprietor.
I am simply a servant engaged by these people for a certain
sum. If I should sell myself to say what I do not think, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to praise what I consider harmful, to propitiate their favor,
I should be a dastard. They understand perfectly that I
never do it, and they never ask me to. Meanwhile, they
employ persons who will do these things. I am not responsible
for it any more than I am for anything else which goes
on in the city of New York. I am allowed my choice
among notices, and I never write them without saying, to
the best of my ability, the exact truth, whether literary
or in a moral point of view. Now, that is just my stand,
and if it satisfies you, you can take the same."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "It makes me indignant, to have Goldstick
talk to me as he did about a great self-denying moral enterprise&mdash;why,
that man must know he's a liar."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said he. "I don't imagine he does.
Goldstick has considerable sentiment. It's quite easy to
get him excited on moral subjects, and he dearly loves to
hear himself talk&mdash;he is sincerely interested in a good number
of moral reforms, so long as they cost him nothing;
and when a man is working his good faculties, he is generally
delighted with himself, and it is the most natural
thing in the world, to think that there is more of him
than there is. I am often put in mind of that enthusiastic
young ruler that came to the Saviour, who had
kept all the commandments, and seemed determined to be
on the high road to saintship. The Saviour just touched
him on this financial question, and he wilted in a minute.
I consider that to be still the test question, and there are a
good many young rulers like him, who <em>don't</em> keep all the
commandments."</p>

<p>"Your way of talking," said I, "seems to do away with
all moral indignation."</p>

<p>He smiled, and then looked sadly into the fire&mdash;"God help
us all," he said. "We are all struggling in the water together
and pulling one another under&mdash;our best virtues are
such a miserable muddle&mdash;and then&mdash;there's the beam in
our own eye."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a depth of pathos in his dark eyes as he spoke,
and suddenly a smile flashed over his features, and looking
around, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"P. G.'s?" said I, innocently.</p>

<p>"Yes; you know that's what Plato calls pretty girls. I
don't believe you remember your Greek. I'm going out this
evening where there's a lot of 'em&mdash;splendid house on Fifth

'em I shall take yet. Don't you want to go with me and

<p>Jim stood at the looking-glass brushing his hair and arranging
his necktie.</p>

<p>"Jim Fellows, you are a coxcomb," said I.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I shouldn't be," said he. "The girls
fairly throw themselves at one's head. They are up to all
that sort of thing. Besides, I'm on the lookout for my fortune,
and it all comes in the way of business. Come, now,
don't sit there writing all the evening. Come out, and let
me show you New York by gaslight."</p>

<p>"No," said I; "I've got to finish up this article for the
<cite>Milky Way</cite>. The fact is, a fellow must be industrious to
make anything, and my time for seeing girls isn't come yet.
I must have something to support a wife on before I look
round in that direction."</p>

<p>"The idea, Harry, of a good-looking fellow like you, not
making the most of his advantages! Why, there are nice
girls in this city that could help you up faster than all the
writing you can do these ten years. And you sitting, moiling
and toiling, when you ought to be making some lovely
woman happy!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall never marry for money, Jim, you may depend
upon that."</p>

<p>"Bah, bah, black sheep," said Jim. "Who is talking
about marrying for money? A fine girl is none the worse
for fifty thousand dollars, and I can give you a list of
twenty that you can go round among until you fall in love,
and not come amiss anywhere, if it's falling in love that
you want to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Jim," said I, "do finish your toilet and be off
with yourself if you are going. I don't blame a <em>woman</em> who
marries for money, since the whole world has always agreed
to shut her out of any other way of gaining an independence.
But for a man, with every other avenue open to him, to
mouse about for a rich wife, I think is too dastardly for
anything."</p>

<p>"That would make a fine point for a paragraph," said Jim,
turning round to me, with perfect good humor. "So I advise
you to save it for the moral part of the paper. You see, if
you waste too much of that sort of thing on me, your mill
may run low. It's a deuced hard thing to keep the moral
agoing the whole year, you'll find."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I am going to try to make a home for a
wife, by good, thorough work, done just as work ought to be
done; and I have no time to waste on society in the meanwhile."</p>

<p>"And when you are ready for her," said Jim, "I suppose
you expect to receive her per 'Divine Providence' Express,
ticketed and labeled, and expenses paid. Or, may be she'll
be brought to you some time by genii, as the Princess of
China was brought to the Prince of Tartary, when he was
asleep. I used to read about that in the Arabian tales."</p>

<p>I give this little passage of my conversation with Jim, because
it is a pretty good illustration of the axiom, that "It
is not in man that walketh to direct his steps." When we
have announced any settled purpose or sublime intention,
in regard to our future course of life, it seems to be the
delight of fortune to throw us directly into circumstances in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
which we shall be tempted to do what we have just declared
we never will do, and the fortunes of our lives turn upon
the most inconsiderable hinges.</p>

<p>Mine turned upon an umbrella.</p>

<p>The next morning I had business in the very lowermost
part of the city, and started off without my umbrella; but
being weather-wise, and discerning the face of the sky,
I went back to my room and took it. It was one of those
little pet objects of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vertu</i>, to which a bachelor sometimes
treats himself in lieu of domestic luxuries. It had a finely-carved
handle, which I bought in Dieppe, and which caused
it to be peculiar among all the umbrellas in New York.</p>

<p>It was one of those uncertain, capricious days that mark
the coming in of April, when Nature, like a nervous beauty,
doesn't seem to know her own mind, and laughs one moment
and cries the next with a perplexing uncertainty.</p>

<p>The first part of the morning the amiable and smiling
predominated, and I began to regret that I had encumbered
myself with the troublesome precaution of an umbrella
while tramping around down town. In this mood of mind
I sat at Fulton Ferry waiting the starting of the Bleecker
street car, when suddenly the scene was enlivened
to my view by the entrance of a young lady, who happened
to seat herself exactly opposite to me.</p>

<p>Now, as a writer, an observer of life and manners, I
had often made quiet studies of the fair flowers of modern
New York society as I rode up and down in the cars.
In no other country in the world, perhaps, has a man the
opportunity of being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> with the best and most cultured
class of young women in the public conveyances. In
England, this class are veiled and secluded from gaze by
all the ordinances and arrangements of society. They go
out only in their own carriage; they travel in reserved
compartments of the railway carriages; they pass from
these to reserved apartments in the hotels, where they are
served apart in family privacy as much as in their own
dwellings. So that the stranger traveling in the country,
unless he have introductions to the personal hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of these circles, has almost no way of forming any
opinion even as to the external appearance of its younger
women. In France, a still stricter <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> watches over the
young, unmarried girl, who is kept in the shade of an almost
conventual seclusion till marriage opens the doors of her
prison. The young American girl, however, of the better
and of the best classes, is to be met and observed everywhere.
She moves through life with the assured step of a
princess, too certain of her position and familiar with her
power even to dream of a fear. She looks on her surroundings
from above with the eye of a mistress, and expects, of
course, to see all things give way before her, as in our republican
society they generally do.</p>

<p>During the few months I had spent in New York I had
diligently kept out of society. The permitted silent acquaintance
with my fair countrywomen which I gained
while riding up and down the street conveyances, became,
therefore, a favorite and harmless source of amusement.
Not an item in the study escaped me, not a feather in that
rustling and wonderful plumage of fashion that bore them
up, was unnoted. I mused on styles, and characteristics,
and silently wove in my own mind histories to correspond
with the various physiognomies I studied. Let not the
reader imagine me staring point blank, with my mouth
open, at all I met. The art of noting without appealing to
note, of seeing without seeming to see, was one that I cultivated
with assiduity.</p>

<p>Therefore, without any impertinent scrutiny, satisfied
myself of the fact that a feminine presence of an unusual
kind and quality was opposite to me. It was, at first glance,
one of the New York princesses of the blood, accustomed to
treading on clouds and breathing incense. There was a
quiet <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir faire</i> and self-possession as she sat down on her
seat, as if it were a throne; and there was a species of repressed
vitality and decision in all her little involuntary
movements that interested me as live things always do
interest, in proportion to their quantum of life. We all are
familiar with the fact that there are some people, who, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
them sit still as they may, and conduct themselves never so
quietly, nevertheless impress their personality on those
around them, and make their presence felt. An attraction
of this sort drew my eyes toward my neighbor. She was a
young lady of medium height, slender and elastic figure,
features less regularly beautiful than piquant and expressive.
I remarked a pair of fine dark eyes the more from the
contrast with a golden crêpe of hair. The combination of
dark eyes and lashes with fair hair, always produces effect
of a striking character. She was attired as became a
Fifth Avenue princess, who has the world of fashion at her
feet,&mdash;yet, to my thinking, as one who had chosen and
adapted her material with an eye of taste. A delicate
cashmere was folded carelessly round her shoulders, and
her little hands were gloved with a careful nicety of fit;
and dangling from one finger was a toy purse of gold and
pearl, in which she began searching for the change to pay
her fare. I saw, too, as she investigated, an expression of
perplexity, slightly tinged with the ludicrous, upon her face.
I perceived at a glance the matter. She was surveying a
ten-dollar note with a glance of amused vexation, and vainly
turning over her little purse for the smaller change or
tickets available in the situation. I leaned forward and
offered, as gentlemen generally do, to take her fare and
pass it forward. With a smile of apology she handed me
the bill, and showed the little empty purse. "Allow me
to arrange it," I said. She smiled and blushed. I passed up
the ticket necessary for the occasion, returned her bill,
bowed, and immediately looked another way with sedulous
care.</p>

<p>It requires an extra amount of discretion and delicacy
to make it tolerable to a true lady to become in the smallest
degree indebted to a gentleman who is a stranger. I was
aware that my fair <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> was inwardly disturbed at
having inadvertently been obliged to accept from me even
so small an obligation as a fare ticket; but as matters were,
there was no help for it. On the whole, though I was sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
for her, I could not but regard the incident as a species of
good luck for myself. We rode along&mdash;perhaps each of us
conscious at times of being attentively considered by the
other, until the cars turned up Park Row before the Astor
House; she signalled the conductor to stop, and got out.
Here it was that the beneficent intentions of the fates, in
causing me to bring my umbrella, were made manifest.</p>

<p>"Before a very elegant house in Fifth Avenue my unknown alighted,
and the rain still continuing, there was an excuse for my still attending
her up the steps."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Just as the car started again, came one of those sudden
gushes of rain with which perverse April delights to ruffle
and discompose unwary passengers. It was less a decent,
decorous shower, than a dash of water by the bucketful.
Immediately I jumped out and stepped to the side of my
gentle neighbor, begging her to allow me to hold my umbrella
over her, and see her in safety across Broadway. She
meant to have stopped at one or two places, she said, but it
rained so she would thank me to put her into a Fifth
Avenue stage. So we went together, threading our way
through rushing and trampling carriages, horses, and cars,&mdash;a
driving storm above, below, and around, which seemed
to throw my fair princess entirely upon my protection for
a few moments, till I had her safe in the up-town omnibus.
As it was my route, also, I, too, entered, and by this time
feeling a sort of privilege of acquaintance, arranged the
fare for her, and again received a courteous and apologetic
acknowledgment. Before a very elegant house in Fifth
Avenue my unknown alighted, and the rain still continuing,
there was an excuse for my attending her up the steps,
and ringing the door-bell for her.</p>

<p>We were kept waiting in this position several minutes,
when she very gracefully expressed her thanks for my
kindness, and begged that I would walk in.</p>

<p>Surprised and pleased, I excused myself on plea of engagements,
but presented her with my card, and said I
would do myself the pleasure of calling at another time.</p>

<p>With a little laugh and blush she handed me a card from
the tiny pearl and gold case, on which was engraved "Eva
Van Arsdel," and in the corner, "<em>Wednesdays</em>."</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></p>

<p>"We receive on Wednesdays, Mr. Henderson," she said,
"and mamma will be so happy to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>Here the door opened, and my fairy princess vanished
from view, with a parting vision of a blush, smile, and bow,
and I was left outside with the rain and the mud and the
dull, commonplace grind of my daily work.</p>

<p>The house, as I noted it, was palatial in its aspect.
Clear, large windows, which seemed a single sheet of
crystal, gave a view of banks of flowering hyacinths,
daffodils, crocuses, and roses, curtained in by misty falls of
lace drapery. Evidently it was one of those Circean regions
of retreat, where the lovely daughters of fashionable
wealth in New York keep guard over an eternal lotus-eater's
paradise; where they tread on enchanted carpets,
move to the sound of music, and live among flowers and
odors a life of blissful ignorance of toil or care.</p>

<p>"To what purpose," I thought to myself, "should I call
there, or pursue the vision into its own regions? Æneas
might as well try to follow Venus to the scented regions
above Idalia, where her hundred altars forever burn, and
her flowers never die."</p>

<p>But yet I was no wiser and no older than other men at
three-and-twenty, and the little card which I had placed
in my vest pocket seemed to diffuse an agreeable, electric
warmth, which constantly reminded me of its presence
there. I took it out and looked at it. I spelled the name
over, and dwelt on every letter. There was so much positive
<em>character</em> in the little lady,&mdash;such a sort of spicy, racy
individuality, that the little I had seen of her was like reading
the first page of an enchanting romance, and I could
not repress a curiosity to go on with it. To-day was Monday;
the reception day was Wednesday. Should I go?</p>

<p>Prudence said, "No; you are a young man with your way
to make; you are self-dependent; you are poor; you have
no time to spend in helping rich idle people to hunt butterflies,
and string rose-leaves, and make dandelion-chains.
If you set your foot over one of those enchanted thresholds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
where wealth and idleness rule together, you will be bewildered,
enervated, and spoiled for any really high or severe
task-work; you will become an idler, a dangler; the
power of sustained labor and self-denial will depart from
you, and you will run like a breathless lackey after the
chariot of wealth and fashion."</p>

<p>On the other hand, as the little bit of enchanted pasteboard
gently burned in my vest pocket, it said:</p>

<p>"Why should you be rude? It is incumbent on you as a
gentleman to respond to the invitation so frankly given.
Besides, the writer who aspires to influence society must
know society; and how can one know society unless one
studies it? A hermit in his cell is no judge of what is
going on in the world. Besides, he does not overcome the
world who runs away from it, but he who meets it bravely.
It is the part of a coward to be afraid of meeting wealth and
luxury and indolence on their own grounds. He really conquers
who can keep awake, walking straight through the
enchanted ground; not he who makes a detour to get
round it."</p>

<p>All which I had arrayed in good set terms as I rode back
to my room, and went up to Bolton to look up in his library
the authorities for an article I was getting out on the Domestic
Life of the Ancient Greeks. Bolton had succeeded in
making me feel so thoroughly at home in his library that
it was to all intents and purposes as if it were my own.</p>

<p>As I was tumbling over the books that filled every corner,
there fell out from a little niche a photograph, or
rather ambrotype, such as were in use in the infancy of the
art. It fell directly into my hand, so that taking it up it
was impossible not to perceive what it was, and I recognized
in an instant the person. It was the head of my
cousin Caroline, not as I knew her now, but as I remembered
her years ago, when she and I went to the Academy
together.</p>

<p>It is almost an involuntary thing, on such occasions, to
exclaim, "Who is this?" But Bolton was so very reticent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
being that I found it extremely difficult to ask him a personal
question. There are individuals who unite a great winning
and sympathetic faculty with great reticence. They
make <em>you</em> talk, they win your confidence, they are interested
in you, but they ask nothing from you, and they tell you
nothing. Bolton was all the while doing obliging things
for me and for Jim, but he asked nothing from us; and
while we felt safe in saying anything in the world before
him, and while we never felt at the moment that conversation
flagged, or that there was any deficiency in sympathy
and good fellowship on his part, yet upon reflection
we could never recall anything which let us into the interior
of his own life-history.</p>

<p>The finding of this little memento impressed me, therefore,
oddly,&mdash;as if a door had suddenly been opened into a
private cabinet where I had no right to look, or an open
letter which I had no right to read had been inadvertently
put into my hands. I looked round on Bolton, as he sat
quietly bending over a book that he was consulting, with
his pen in hand and his cat at his elbow; but the question I
longed to ask stuck fast in my throat, and I silently put
back the picture in its place, keeping the incident to ponder
in my heart. What with the one pertaining to myself, and
with the thoughts suggested by this, I found myself in a disturbed
state that I determined to resist by setting myself
a definite task of so many pages of my article.</p>

<p>In the evening, when Jim came in, I recounted my adventure
and showed him the card.</p>

<p>He surveyed it with a prolonged whistle. "Good now!"
he said; "the ticket sent by the Providence Express. I
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who are these Van Arsdels, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Upper tens," said Jim, decisively. "Not the oldest Tens,
but the second batch. Not the old Knickerbocker Vanderhoof,
and Vanderhyde, and Vanderhorn set that Washy
Irving tells about,&mdash;but the modern nobs. Old Van Arsdel
does a smashing importing business&mdash;is worth his millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>&mdash;has
five girls, all handsome&mdash;two out&mdash;two more to come
out, and one strong-minded sister who has retired from
the world, and isn't seen out anywhere. The one you saw
was Eva; they say she's to marry Wat Sydney,&mdash;the greatest
match there is going in New York. How do you say&mdash;shall
you go, Wednesday?"</p>

<p>"Do you know them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Alice Van Arsdel is a splendid girl, and we are
good friends, and I look in on them sometimes just to
give them the light of my countenance. They are always
after me to lead the German in their parties; but I've given
that up. Hang it all! it's too steep on a fellow that has to
work all day, with no let up, to be kept dancing till daylight
with those girls. It don't pay!"</p>

<p>"I should think not," said I.</p>

<p>"You see," pursued Jim, "these girls have nothing under
heaven to do, and when they've danced all night, <em>they</em> go to
bed and sleep till eleven or twelve o'clock the next day
and get their rest; while we fellows have to be up and in
our offices at eight o'clock next morning. The fact is, it
may do for once or twice, but it knocks a fellow up pretty
fast. It's a bad thing for the fellows; they get to taking
wine and brandy and one thing or another to keep up, and
the Devil only knows what comes of it."</p>

<p>"And are these Van Arsdels in that frivolous set?" said I.</p>

<p>"Well, you see they are not really frivolous, either;
they are nice girls, well educated, graduated at the Universal
Thingumbob College, where they teach girls everything
that ever has been heard of, before they are seventeen.
And then they have lived in Paris, and lived in Germany,
and lived in Italy, and picked up all the languages; so
that when they have anything to say they have a choice of
four languages to say it in."</p>

<p>"And have they anything to say worth hearing in any of
the four?" said I.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, now, honor bright. There's Alice Van Arsdel:
she's ambitious as the devil, but, after all, a good, warm-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
girl under it&mdash;and smart! there's no doubt of that."</p>

<p>"And <em>this</em> lady?" said I, fingering the card.</p>

<p>"Eva? Well, she's had a great run; she's killing, as they
say, and she's pretty&mdash;no denying that; and, really, there's
a good deal to her,&mdash;like the sponge cake at the bottom of
the trifle, you know, with a good smart flavor of wine and
spice."</p>

<p>"And she's engaged to&mdash;whom did you say?"</p>

<p>"Wat Sydney."</p>

<p>"And what sort of a man is he?"</p>

<p>"What sort? why, he's a <em>rich</em> man; owns all sorts of
things,&mdash;gold mines in California, and copper mines in Lake
Superior, and salt works, and railroads. In fact, the thing
is to say what he doesn't own. Immense head for
business,&mdash;regular steel-trap to deal with,&mdash;has the snap of a pike."</p>

<p>"Pleasing prospect for a domestic companion," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, I believe Wat is good-hearted enough to
his own folks. They say he is very devoted to his old
mother and a parcel of old maid aunts, and as he's rich, it's
thought a great virtue. Nobody sings <em>my</em> praises, I notice,
because I mind my mammy and Aunt Sarah. You see it
takes a million-power solar microscope to bring out fellows'
virtues."</p>

<p>"Is the gentleman handsome?"</p>

<p>"Well, if he was poor, nobody would think much of
his looks. If he had, say, a hundred thousand or two, he
would be called fair to middling in looks. As it is, the girls
rave about him. He's been after Eva now for six months,
and the other girls are ready to tear her eyes out. But the
engagement hasn't come out yet. I think she's making up
her mind to him."</p>

<p>"Not in love, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, she's been queen so long she's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasée</i> and difficult,
and likes to play with her fish before she lands him. But of
course she <em>must</em> have him. Girls like that must have
money to keep 'em up; that's the first requisite. I tell you
the purple and fine linen of these princesses come to something.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Now, as <em>rich</em> men go, she'd find ten worse than Wat
where there's one better. Then she's been out three seasons.
There's Alice just come out, and Alice is a stunner,
and takes tremendously! And then there's Angeline, a
handsome, spicy little witch, smarter than either, that is
just fluttering, and scratching, and tearing her hair with
impatience to have her turn. And behind Angeline there's
Marie&mdash;she's got a confounded pair of eyes. So you see
there's no help for it; Miss Eva <em>must</em> abdicate and make
room for the next comer."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "about this reception?"</p>

<p>"Oh! go, by all means," said Jim. "It will be fun. I'll
go with you. You see it's Lent now, thank the stars! and
so there's no dancing,&mdash;only quiet evenings and lobster salad;
because, you see, we're all repenting of our sins and getting
ready to go at it again after Easter. A fellow now can go
to receptions, and get away in time to have a night's rest,
and the girls now and then talk a little sense between
whiles. They <em>can</em> talk sense when they like, though one
wouldn't believe it of 'em. Well, take care of yourself, my
son, and I'll take you round there on Wednesday evening."
And Jim went whistling down the stairs, leaving me to finish
my article on the Domestic Manners of the Greeks.</p>

<p>I remember that very frequently that evening, while
stopping to consider how I should begin the next sentence,
I unconsciously embellished the margin of my manuscript
by writing "Eva, Eva, Eva Van Arsdel" in an absent-minded,
mechanical way. In fact, from that time, that name
began often to obtrude itself on every bit of paper when I
tried my pen.</p>

<p>The question of going to the Wednesday evening reception
was settled in the affirmative. What was to hinder my
taking a look at fairy land in a purely philosophical spirit?
Nothing, certainly. If she were engaged she was nothing
to me,&mdash;never would be. So, clearly there was no danger.</p>

<p class="center">[Letter from Eva Van Arsdel to Mrs. Courtney.]</p>

<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg"
  width="59" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My Dear Friend
and Teacher</span>:&mdash;I scarcely dare
trust myself to look at the date of your kind
letter. Can it really be that I have let it lie
almost a year, hoping, meaning, sincerely intending to
answer it, and yet doing nothing about it? Oh! my
dear friend, I was a better girl while I was under your
care than I am now; in those times I really <em>did</em> my duties;
I never put off things, and I came <em>somewhere</em> near
satisfying myself. Now, I live in a constant whirl&mdash;a whirl
that never ceases. I am carried on from day to day, from
week to week, from month to month, with nothing to show
for it except a succession of what girls call "good times."
I don't read any thing but stories; I don't study; I don't
write; I don't sew; I don't draw, or play, or sing, to any
real purpose. I just "go into society," as they call it. I am
an idler, and the only thing I am good for is that I help to
adorn a house for the entertainment of idlers; that is
about all.</p>

<p>Now Lent has come, and I am thankful for the rest from
parties and dancing; but yet Lent makes me blue, because
it gives me some time to <em>think</em>; and besides that, when all
this whirligig stops awhile, I feel how dizzy and tired it has
made me. And then I think of all that you used to tell me
about the real object of life, and all that I so sincerely
resolved in my school-days that I would do and be, and I
am quite in despair about myself.</p>

<p>It is three years since I really "came out," as the phrase
goes. Up to that time I was far happier than I have been
since, because I satisfied myself better. You always said,
dear friend, that I was a good scholar, and faithful to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
duty; and those days, when I had a definite duty for each
hour, and did it well, were days when I liked myself better
than now. I did <em>enjoy</em> study. I enjoyed our three years
in Europe, too, for then, with much variety and many
pleasures, I had regular studies; I was learning something,
and did not feel that I was a mere do-nothing.</p>

<p>But since I have been going into company I am perfectly
sick of myself. For the first year it was new to me, and I
was light-headed and thought it glorious fun. It was
excitement all the time&mdash;dressing, and going, and seeing,
and being admired, and, well&mdash;flirting. I confess I liked
it, and went into it with all my might,&mdash;parties, balls, opera,
concerts all the winter in New York, and parties, balls, etc.
at Newport and Saratoga in Summer. It was a sort of prolonged
delirium. I didn't stop to think about anything,
and lived like a butterfly, by the hour. Oh! the silly
things I have said and done! I find myself blushing hot
when I think of them, because, you see, I am so excitable,
and sometimes am so carried away, that afterward I don't
know what I may have said or done!</p>

<p>And now all this is coming to some end or other. This
going into company can't last forever. We must be married&mdash;that's
what we are for, they say; that's what all this
dressing, and dancing, and flying about has got to end in.
And so mamma and Aunt Maria are on thorns, to get me
off their hands and well established. I have been out
three seasons. I am twenty-three, and Alice has just come
out, and it is expected, of course, that I retire with honor.
I will not stop to tell you that I have rejected about the
usual number of offers that young ladies in my position get,
and I haven't seen anybody that I care a copper for.</p>

<p>Well, now, in this crisis, comes this Mr. Sidney, who
proposed to me last Fall, and I refused point-blank, simply
and only because I didn't love him, which seemed to me at
that time reason enough. Then mamma and Aunt Maria
took up the case, and told me that I was a foolish girl to
throw away such an offer: a man of good character and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
standing, an excellent business man, and so immensely
rich&mdash;with such a splendid place at Newport, and another
in New York, and a fortune like Aladdin's lamp!</p>

<p>I said I didn't love him, and they said I hadn't tried;
that I <em>could</em> love him if I only made up my mind to, and why
wouldn't I try? Then papa turned in, who very seldom
has anything to say to us girls, or about any family matters,
and said how delighted <em>he</em> should be to see me married to
a man so capable of taking care of me. So, among them all,
I agreed that I would receive his visits and attentions <em>as a
friend</em>, with a view to trying to love him; and ever since I
have been banked up in flowers and confectionery, and
daily drifting into relations of closer and closer intimacy.</p>

<p>Do I find myself in love? Not a bit. Frankly, dear
friend, to tell the awful truth, the thing that weighs down
my heart is, that if this man were not so <em>rich</em>, I <em>know</em> I
shouldn't think of him. If he were a poor young man, just
beginning business, I know I should not give him a second
thought; neither would mother, nor Aunt Maria, nor any of
us. But here are all these worldly advantages! I confess
I am dazzled by them. I am silly, I am weak, I am ambitious.
I like to feel that I may have the prize of the season&mdash;the
greatest offer in the market. I know I am envied
and, oh, dear me! though it's naughty, yet one does like
to be envied. Besides, to tell the truth, though I am not in
love with him, I am not in love with anybody else. I respect
him, and esteem him, and all that, in a quiet, negative sort
of way, and mother and Aunt Maria say everything else
will come&mdash;after marriage. Will it? Is it right? Is this
the way I ought to marry?</p>

<p>But then, you know, I must marry somebody&mdash;that, they
say, is a fixed fact. It seems to be understood that I am a
sort of helpless affair, to be taken care of, and that now is
my time to be disposed of; and they tell me every day that
if I let this chance go, I shall regret it all my life.</p>

<p>Do you know I wish there were convents that one could
go out of the world into? Cousin Sophia Sewell has joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the Sisters of St. John, and says she never was so happy.
She does look so cheerful, and she is so busy from morning
till night, and has the comfort of doing so much good to a
lot of those poor little children, that I envy her.</p>

<p>But I cannot become a Sister. What would mamma say
if she knew I even thought of it? Everybody would think
me crazy. Nobody would believe how much there is in me
that never comes to light, nor how miserable it makes me to
be the poor, half-hearted thing that I am.</p>

<p>You know, dear friend, about sister Ida's peculiar course,
and how very much it has vexed mamma. Yet, really and
truly, I can't help respecting Ida. It seems to me she shows
a real strength of principle that I lack. She went into gay
society only a little while before she gave it up, and her
reasons, I think, were good ones. She said it weakened
her health, weakened her mind; that there was no use in
it, and that it was just making her physically and morally
helpless, and that she wanted to live for a purpose of her
own. She wanted to go to Paris, and study for the medical
profession; but neither papa, nor mamma, nor any of the
family would hear of it. But Ida persisted that she would
do something, and finally papa took her into his business,
to manage the foreign correspondence, which she does admirably,
putting all her knowledge of languages to account.
He gives her the salary of a confidential clerk, and she lays
it up, with the intention finally of carrying her purpose.</p>

<p>Ida is a good, noble woman, of a strength and independence
perfectly incomprehensible to me. I can desire, but
I cannot do; I am weak and irresolute. People can talk
me round, and do anything with me, and I cannot help myself.</p>

<p>Another thing makes me unhappy. Ida refused to be
confirmed when I was, because, she said, confirmation was
only a sham; that the girls were just as wholly worldly after
as before, and that it did no earthly good.</p>

<p>Well, you see, I was confirmed; and, oh dear me! I
was sincere, God knows. I wanted to be good&mdash;to live a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
higher, purer, nobler life than I have lived; and yet, after
all, it is I, the child of the Church, that am living a life
of folly, and show, and self-indulgence; and it is Ida, who
doubts the Church, that is living a life of industry, and
energy, and self-denial.</p>

<p>Why is it? The world that we promise to renounce,
that our sponsors promised that we should renounce&mdash;what
is it, and where is it? Do those vows mean anything? if
so, what? I mean to do all that I ought to; but how to
know what? There's Aunt Maria, my god-mother, she did
the renouncing for me at my baptism, and promised solemnly
that I should abjure "the vain pomp and glory of
the world, with all covetous desires of the same; that I
should not follow, or be led by them;" yet she has never,
that I can see, had one thought of anything else but how
to secure to me just exactly those very things. That I
should be first in society, be admired, followed, flattered,
and make a rich, splendid marriage, has been her very
heart's desire and prayer; and if I <em>should</em> renounce the vain
pomp and glory of the world, really and truly, she would
be utterly heart-broken. So would mamma.</p>

<p>I don't mean to lay all the blame on them, either. <em>I</em> have
been worldly, too, and ambitious, and wanted to shine, and
been only too willing to fall in with all their views.</p>

<p>But it really is hard for a person like me to stand alone,
against my own heart, and all my relatives, particularly
when I don't know exactly, in each case, what to do, and
what not; where to begin to resist, and where to yield.</p>

<p>Ida says that it is a sin to spend nights in dancing, so that
one has to lie in bed like an invalid all the next day. She
says it is a sin to run down one's health for no good purpose;
and yet we girls all do it&mdash;everybody does it. We
all go from party to party, from concert to ball, and from
ball to something else. We dance the German three or
four nights a week; and then, when Sunday comes, sometimes
I find that there is the Holy Communion&mdash;and then I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
am afraid to go. I am like the man that had not on the
wedding garment.</p>

<p>It seems to me that our church services were made for
<em>real</em> Christians&mdash;people like the primitive Christians, who
made a real thing of it; they gave up everything and went
down and worshiped in the catacombs, for instance. I
remember seeing those catacombs where they held their
church far down under ground, when I was in Rome. There
would be some meaning in <em>such</em> people's using our service,
but when I try to go through with it I fear to take such
words on my lips. I wonder that nobody seems to feel how
awful those words are, and how much they must mean, if
they mean anything. It seems to me so solemn to say to
God, as we do say in the communion service, "Here we offer
and present unto Thee, O, Lord, <em>ourselves</em>, our souls and
bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and living sacrifice unto
Thee"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I see so many saying this who never seem to think of
it again; and, oh, my dear friend, I have said it myself, and
been no better afterward, and now, alas, I too often turn
away from the holy ordinance because I feel that it is only a
mockery to utter them, living as I do.</p>

<p>About this marriage. Mr. Sydney is not at all a religious
man; he is all for this world, and I don't think I shall grow
much better by it.</p>

<p>I wish there were somebody that could strengthen me, and
help me to be my better self. I have dreams of a sort of
man like King Arthur, and the Knights of the Holy Grail&mdash;a
man, noble, holy, and religious. Such an one I would follow
if I broke away from everyone else; but, alas, no such
are in our society, at least I never have met any. Yet I
have it in me to love, even to death, if I found a real hero.
I marked a place in a book the other day, which said:</p>

<p>"There is not so much difficulty in being willing to die for
one, as finding one worth dying for."</p>

<p>I haven't, and they laugh at me as a romantic girl when I
tell them what I would do if I found my ideal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, I suppose you see how it's all likely to end. We
drift, and drift and drift, and I shouldn't wonder if I drifted
at last into this marriage. I see it all before me, just what
it will be,&mdash;a wonderful wedding, that turns all New York
topsy turvy&mdash;diamonds, laces, cashmeres, infinite flowers,
and tuberoses of course, till one's head aches,&mdash;clang and
ding, and bang and buzz;&mdash;triumphal processions to all the
watering-places; tour in Europe, and then society life in
New York, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>Oh, dear, if I only could get up some <em>enthusiasm</em> for him!
He likes me, but he don't like the things that I like, and it is
terribly slow work entertaining him&mdash;but when we are
married we shan't see so much of each other, I suppose, and
shall get on as other folks do. Papa and mamma hardly
ever see much of each other, but I suppose they are all
right. Aunt Maria says, love or no love at the beginning,
it all comes to this sort of jog-trot at the end. The husband
is the man that settles the bills, and takes care of the family,
that's all.</p>

<p>Ida says&mdash;but I won't tell you what Ida says&mdash;she always
makes me feel blue.</p>

<p>Do write me a good scolding letter; rouse me up; shame
me, scold me, talk hard to me, and see if you can't make
something of me. Perhaps it isn't too late.</p>

<hr class="tb mt2" />

<p class="centermt2">[Letter from Mrs. Courtney to Eva Van Arsdel.]</p>

<p><i>My Dear Child</i>:&mdash;You place me in an embarrassing position
in asking me to speak on a subject, when your parents
have already declared their wishes.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my dear, I can but remind you that you
are the child of an higher than any earthly mother, and in an
affair of this moment you should take counsel of our holy
Church. Take your prayer-book and read her solemn service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and see what those marriage vows are that you think
of taking. Are these to be taken lightly and unadvisedly?</p>

<p>I recollect, when I was a young girl, we used to read Sir
Charles Grandison, and one passage in the model Harriet
Byron's letters I copied into my scrap-book. Speaking of
one who had proposed to her, she says:</p>

<p>"He seems to want the mind that I would have the man
blessed with that I am to vow to love and honor. I purpose
whenever I marry to make a very good, and even dutiful
wife; must I not vow obedience, and shall I break my marriage
vow? I would not, therefore, on any consideration,
marry a man whose want of knowledge might make me
stagger in the performance of my duty to him; who would,
perhaps, command from caprice or want of understanding
what I think unreasonable to be complied with."</p>

<p>I quote this because I think it is old fashioned good sense,
in a respectable old English novel, worth a dozen of the
modern school. To me, there is indicated in your description
of Mr. Sydney, just that lack of what you would need in a
husband, which would make difficult, perhaps impossible,
the performance of your marriage vows. It is evident that
his mind does not impress yours or control yours, and that
there are no mental sympathies between you.</p>

<p>That a man is a good business man; that he is fitted to
secure the rent or taxes of the house one lives in, and to pay
one's bills, is not all. Think, my child, that this man, for
whom you can "get up no enthusiasm," whose company
wearies you, is the one whom you are proposing to take by
the hand before God's altar, and solemnly promise that <em>forsaking
all others</em>, you will <em>keep only unto</em> him, so long as you
both shall live, to love, to honor, and to obey. Can you
do it?</p>

<p>You say you can get up no enthusiasm for this man, yet
you have a conception of a man for whom you could leave all
things; whom you <em>could</em> love unto the death.</p>

<p>It is out of just such marriages, made by girls with just
such hearts as yours, that come all these troubles that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
bringing holy marriage into disrepute in our times. A
woman marries, thoughtlessly and unadvisedly, a man whom
she consciously does not love, hoping that she <em>shall</em> love him,
or that she shall do as well as others do; then by accident or
chance she is thrown into the society of the very one whom
she could have loved with enthusiasm, and married, for himself
alone. The modern school of novels are full of these
wretched stories, and people now are clamoring for free
divorce, to get out of marriages that they never ought to
have fallen into.</p>

<p>Amid all this confusion the Church stands from age to age
and teaches. She shows you exactly what you are to promise;
she warns you against promising lightly, or unadvisedly,
and I can only refer my dear child to her mother's
lessons. Marriage vows, like confirmation vows, are recorded
in Heaven, and must not be broken.</p>

<p>The time for reflection is before they are made. Instead
of clamoring for free divorce, as a purifier of marriage, all
Christians should purify it as the church recommends, by
the great care with which they enter into it. That is my
doctrine, my love. I am a good old English Church-woman,
and don't believe in any modern theories. The teachings of
the prayer-book are enough for me. I know that, in spite of
them all, there are thoughtless confirmation vows and marriage
vows daily uttered in our church, but it is not for want
of clear and solemn instruction. But you, my love, with
your conscientiousness, and good sense, and really noble
nature, will I am sure act worthily of yourself in this matter.</p>

<p>Another consideration I suggest to you. This man, whom
I suppose to be a worthy and excellent man, has his rights.
He has the right to the whole heart of the woman he marries&mdash;to
whom at the altar he gives himself and all which he
possesses. A woman who has what you call an enthusiasm
for a man, can do much with him. She can bear with his
faults; she can inspire and lead him; she can raise him in
the scale of being. But without this enthusiasm, this real
love, she can do nothing of the kind; it is a thing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
cannot be dissembled, or affected. And after marriage, the
man who does not find this in his wife, has the best reason
to think himself defrauded.</p>

<p>Now, if for the sake of possessing a man's worldly goods,
his advantages of fortune and station, you take that relation
when you really are unable to give him your heart, you act
dishonestly. You take and enjoy what you cannot pay for.
Not only that, but you deprive him through all his life of the
blessing of being really loved, which he might obtain with
some other woman.</p>

<p>The fact is, you have been highly cultivated in certain
departments; your tastes would lead you into the world of
art and literature. He has been devoted to business, and in
that way has amassed a fortune, but he has no knowledge,
and no habits that would prepare him to sympathise with
you.</p>

<p>I am not here undervaluing the worth of those strong,
sterling qualities which belong to an upright and vigorous
man. There are many women who are impressed by just
that sort of power, and admire it in men, as they do physical
strength and courage; it dazzles their imagination, and
they fall in love accordingly. You happen to have another
kind of fancy&mdash;he is not of your sort.</p>

<p>But there are doubtless women whom he would fully satisfy;
who would find him a delightful companion who, in
short, would be exactly what you are not, in love with him.
My dear, men need wives who are <em>in love</em> with them. Simple
tolerance is not enough to stand the strain of married life,
and to marry when you cannot truly love is to commit an
act of dishonesty and injustice. Remembering, therefore,
that you are about to do what never can be undone, and
what must make or mar your whole future, I speak this in
all sincere plainness, because I am, and ever must be,</p>

<p class="centermt2">[Ida Van Arsdel to Mrs. Courtney.]</p>

<p><i>My Dear Friend</i>:&mdash;I am glad you have written as you have
to Eva. It is perfectly inexplicable to me that a girl of her
general strength of character can be so undecided. Eva has
been deteriorating ever since she came from Europe. This
fashionable life is to mind and body just like a hotbed to
tender plants in summer, it wilts everything down. Eva was
a good scholar and I had great hopes of her. She had a
warm heart; she has really high and noble aspirations, but
for two or three years past she has done nothing but run
down her health and fritter away her mind on trifles. She
is not half the girl she was at school, either mentally or
physically, and I am grieved and indignant at the waste.
Her only chance of escape and salvation is to marry a true
man.</p>

<p>But when people set out as a first requisite that the man
<em>must</em> be rich, how many are the chances of finding that?</p>

<p>The rich men of America are either rich men's sons, who,
from all I have seen of them, are poor trash enough, or business
men, who have made wealth by their own exertions.
But how few there are who make money, who do not sacrifice
their spiritual and nobler natures to do it? How few
with whom the making of money is not the beginning, middle,
and end of life, and how little can such men do to
uphold and elevate the moral nature of a wife!</p>

<p>Mr. Sydney is a man, heart, soul, and strength, interested
in that mighty game of chance and skill by which, in
America, money is made. He is a railroad king&mdash;a prince
of stocks&mdash;a man going with a forty thousand steam power
through New York waters. He wants a wife&mdash;a brilliant,
attractive, showy, dressy wife, to keep his house and ornament
his home; and he is at Eva's feet, because she is, on the
whole, the belle of his circle. He chooses <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en Grand Seigneur</i>,
and undoubtedly he is as much in love with her as such a
kind of man can be. But, in fact, he knows nothing about
Eva; he does not even know enough to know the dangers
of marrying such a woman. With all her fire, and all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
softness, all her restless enthusiasms, her longings and aspirations
and inconsistencies, what could he do with her?
The man who marries Eva ought to know her better than
she knows herself, but this man never would know her, if
they lived together an age. He has no traits by which to
estimate her, and the very best result of the marriage will
be a mutual <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laisser aller</i> of two people who agree not to
quarrel, and to go their own separate ways, he to his world,
and she to hers; and this sort of thing is what is called in
our times a good marriage.</p>

<p>I am out of patience with Eva for her very virtues. It is
her instinct to want to please and to comply, and because
mamma and aunt Maria have set their heart on this match,
and because she is empty-hearted and tired, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyeuse</i>,
she has no strength to stand up for herself. Her very conscientiousness
weakens her; she doubts, but does not decide.
She has just enough of everything in her nature to get her
into trouble, and not enough to get her out. A phrenologist
told her she needed destructiveness. Well, she does. The
pain-giving power is a most necessary part of a well organized
human being. Nobody can ever do anything without
the courage to be disagreeable at times, which I have plenty
of. They do not try to control me, or enslave me. Why?
Because I made my declaration of independence, and planted
my guns, and got ready for war. This is dreadfully unamiable,
but it did the thing; it secured peace; I am let alone.
I am allowed my freedom, but everybody interferes with
Eva. She is conquered territory&mdash;has no rights that anybody
is bound to respect. It provokes me.</p>

<p>As to the religious part of your letter, dear friend, I
thank you for it. I cannot see things as you do, however.
To me it appears that in our day everything has got to be
brought to the simple test of, What good does it do? If
baptism, confirmation and eucharist make unworldly, self-denying,
self-sacrificing people just as certainly as petunia-seed
make petunias, why, then, nobody will have any doubt
of their necessity, and the church will have its throngs. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
don't see now that they do. Go into a fashionable party I
have been in, and watch the girls, and see if you can tell
who have been baptized and confirmed, and who have not.</p>

<p>The first Christians carried Christianity over all the pomp
and power of the world simply by the unworldly life they
lived. Nobody doubted where the true church was in those
days. Christians were a set of people like nobody else in the
world, and whenever and wherever and by whatever means
that <em>kind of character</em> that they had is created, it will have
power.</p>

<p>I like the Episcopal Church, but I cannot call it <em>the</em> church
till I see evidences that it answers practically the purpose of
a church better than any other. For my part I go to hear a
dreadfully heretical preacher on Sunday, who lectures in a
black-coat in a hall, simply because he talks to me on points
of duty, which I am anxious to hear discussed. Eva, poor
child, wears down her health and strength with night after
night in society, and spends all her money on dress; doing
no earthly thing for any living creature, except in the pleasure-giving
way, like a bird or a flower, and then is shocked
and worried about me because I read scientific works on
Sunday.</p>

<p>I make conscience of good health, early hours, thick
shoes, and mental and bodily drill, and subjection. Please
God, I mean to do something worthy a Christian woman
before I die, and to open a path through which weaker
women shall walk out of this morass of fashion-slavery, and
subjection, where they flounder now. I take for my motto
that sentence from one of Dr. Johnson's allegories you once
read to us: "No life pleasing to God that is not useful to
man." I hope, my dear friend, I shall keep the spirit of
Christ, though I wander from the letter. Such words as
you have spoken to me, however, can never come amiss.
Perhaps when I am old and wiser, like many another self-confident
wanderer, I may be glad to come back to my
mother's house, and then, perhaps, I shall be a stiff little
church-woman. At all events I shall always be your loving
and grateful pupil.</p>

<p class="centermt2">[Eva Van Arsdel to Isabel Convers.]</p>

<p><i>My Dear Belle</i>: Thanks for your kind letter with all its
congratulations and inquiries,&mdash;for though as yet I have no
occasion for congratulation, and nothing to answer to
inquiry, I appreciate these all the same.</p>

<p>No&mdash;Belle, the "old sixpence" is not gone yet,&mdash;you will
have to keep to your friend a while longer. I am not
engaged, and you have full liberty to contradict that report
everywhere and anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. Sydney is, of course, very polite, and very devoted,
very much a friend of the family and all that, but I am <em>not</em>
engaged to him, and you need never believe any such thing
of me till you hear it directly, under my own hand and seal.</p>

<p>There have been a lot of engagements in our set lately.
Lottie Trevillian is going to marry Sim Carrington, and
Bessie Somers has at last decided to take old Watkins&mdash;though
he is twenty-five years older than she,&mdash;and then
there's Cousin Maria Elmore has just turned a splendid
affair with young Livingstone, really the most brilliant
match of the winter. I am positively ashamed of myself,
under these circumstances, to be sitting still, and unable
to report progress. My old infelicity in making up my
mind seems to haunt me, and I dare say I shall live to be a
dreadful example.</p>

<p>By the by, I have had a curious sort of an adventure
lately. You know when I was up at Englewood visiting
you last summer, I was just raving over those sonnets on
Italy, which appeared in the "<cite>Milky Way</cite>" over the signature
of "X." You remember those verses on "Fra Angelico"
and the "Campanile," don't you? Well, I have found out
who this X is. It's a Mr. Henderson that is now in New
York, engaged on the staff of "<cite>The Great Democracy</cite>." We
girls have noticed him once or twice walking with Jim
Fellows&mdash;(you remember Jim;) Jim says he is a perfect
hermit, devoted to study and writing, and never goes into
society. Well, wasn't it odd that the fates should have
thrown this hermit just in my way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The other morning I came over from Brooklyn, where I
had been spending three days with Sophia, and when I got
into the car who should I see but this identical Mr. Henderson
right opposite to me. I took a quiet note of him,
between whiles thinking of one or two lines in his sonnet.
He is nice-looking, manly, that is, and has fine dark eyes.
Well, do you know, the most provoking thing, when I came
to pay my fare I found that I had no tickets nor small
change&mdash;what could have possessed me to come so I can't
imagine, and mamma makes it all the worse by saying it's
just like me. However, he interposed and arranged it for
me in the nicest and quietest way in the world. I was going
up to call at Jennings', the other side of the Astor House, to
see about my laces, but by the time we got there, there
came on such a rain as was perfectly dreadful. My dear, it
was one of those shocking affairs peculiar to New York,
which really come down by the bucketful, and I had nothing
for it but to cross Broadway as quick as I could to catch a
Fifth Avenue omnibus, and let my lace go till a more convenient
season.</p>

<p>Well, as I stepped out into the storm, who should I
find quite beside me but this gentleman, with his umbrella
over my head. I could see at the moment that it had one
of those quaint handles that they carve in Dieppe. We
were among cars, and policemen, and trampling horses, and
so on, but he got me safe into an up-town omnibus, and I
felt so much obliged to him.</p>

<p>I supposed, of course, that there it might end, but, would
you believe it, quite to my surprise, he got into the omnibus
too! "After all," I said to myself, "perhaps his route lies up
town like mine." He wasn't in the least presuming, and
sat there very quietly, only saying, "Permit me," as he passed
up a ticket for me when the fare was to be paid, so saving
me that odious necessity of making change with my great
awkward bill. I was mortified enough&mdash;but knowing who
it was, had a sort of internal hope that one day I could apologize
and make it all right, for, my dear, I determined on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
spot that we would invite him to our receptions, and get
Jim Fellows to make him come. I think there is no test of
a gentleman like the manner in which he does a favor for a
stranger lady whom the fates cast upon his protection. So
many would be insufferably presuming and assuming&mdash;he
was just right, so quiet, so simple, so unpretentious, yet so
considerate.</p>

<p>He rode on very quietly till we were opposite our house,
and then was on duty again with his umbrella, up to the
very door of the house, and holding it over me while we
were waiting. I couldn't help expressing my thanks, and
asking him to walk in; but he excused himself, giving his
card, and saying he would be happy to call and inquire
after my health, etc.; and I gave him mine, with our
Wednesday receptions on it, and told him how pleased
mamma would be to have him call. It was all I could do to
avoid calling him by his name, and letting him see how
much I knew about him; but I didn't. It was rather awkward,
wasn't it?</p>

<p>Now, I wonder if he will call on Wednesdays. Jim Fellows
says he is so shy, and never goes out; and you know if
there is anything that can't be had, that is the thing one is
wild to get; so mamma and all of us are quite excited, and
wondering if he will come. Mamma is all anxiety to apologize,
and all that, for the trouble I have given him.</p>

<p>It's rather funny, isn't it&mdash;an adventure in prosaic old
New York? I dare say, now, he has forgotten all about it,
and never will think of coming into such a trifling set as we
girls are. Well, I will let you know if he comes.</p>

<p class="ph3">I AM INTRODUCED INTO SOCIETY.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_b.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Bolton</span> and I were sitting, up to our ears in new
books which had been accumulating for notice for
days past, and which I was turning over and dipping
into here and there with the jaded, half-disgusted air of
a child worn out by the profusion of a Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p>"I feel perfectly savage," I said. "What a never-ending
harvest of trash! Two, or at the most, three tolerable
ideas, turned and twisted in some novel device, got up in
large print, with wide margins&mdash;and, behold, a modern
book! I would like to be a black frost and nip them all
in a night!"</p>

<p>"Your dinner didn't agree with you, apparently," said
Bolton, as he looked up from a new scientific work he was
patiently analyzing, making careful notes along the margin;
"however, turn those books over to Jim, who understands
the hop, skip, and jump style of criticism. Jim has about a
dozen or two of blank forms that only need the name of
the book and publisher inserted, and the work is done."</p>

<p>"What a perfect farce," said I.</p>

<p>"The notices are as good as the books," said Bolton.
"Something has to be said to satisfy the publishers and do
the handsome thing by them; and the usual string of commendatory
phrases and trite criticism, which mean nothing
in particular, I presume imposes upon nobody. It is merely
a form of announcing that such and such wares are in the
market. I fancy they have very little influence on public
opinion."</p>

<p>"But do you think," said I, "that there is any hope of a
just school of book criticism&mdash;something that should be a
real guide to buyers and readers, and a real instruction to
writers?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a large question," said Bolton, "and a matter
beset with serious difficulties. While books are a matter of
commerce and trade; while magazines which criticise books
are the property of booksellers, and newspapers depend on
them for advertising patronage, it is too much to expect of
human nature, that we should always get wholly honest,
unbiassed opinions. Then, again, there is the haste, and
rush, and hurry of our times, the amount of literary drift-wood
that is all the while accumulating! Editors and critics
are but mortal men, and men kept, as a general thing, in the
last agonies of weariness and boredom. There is not, for
the most part, sensibility enough left to enable them to read
through or enter into the purport of one book in a hundred;
yet, for all this, you do observe here and there in the columns
of our best papers carefully studied and seriously written
critiques on books; these are hopeful signs. They show a
conscientious effort on the part of the writers to enter into
the spirit of the work, and to give their readers a fair
account of it; and, if I mistake not, the number of such is
on the increase."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "do you suppose there is any prospect or
possibility of a <em>constructive</em> school of criticism&mdash;honest, yet
kindly and sympathetic, that shall lead young authors into
right methods of perfecting themselves?"</p>

<p>"We have a long while to wait before that comes," said
Bolton. "Who is appreciative and many-sided enough to
guide the first efforts of genius just coming to consciousness?
How many could profitably have advised Hawthorne
when his peculiar Rembrandt style was just forming? As
a race, we Anglo Saxons are so self-sphered that we lack
the power to enter into the individuality of another mind,
and give profitable advice for its direction.</p>

<p>"English criticism has generally been unappreciative and
brutal; it has dissected butterflies and humming-birds with
mallet and cleaver&mdash;witness the review that murdered
Keats, and witness in the letters of Charlotte Bronté the
perplexity into which sensitive, conscientious genius was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
thrown by obstreperous, conflicting criticism. The most
helpful, because most appreciative reviews, she says, came
to her from France."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said I, "that it is the dramatic element in
the French character that fits them to be good literary critics.
They can enter into another individuality. One would
think it a matter of mere common sense, that in order to
criticise justly you must put yourself for the time being as
nearly as possible at the author's point of sight; form a
sympathetic estimate of what he is striving to do, and then
you can tell how nearly he attains his purpose. Of this
delicate constructive criticism, we have as yet, it seems to
me, almost no specimens in the English language. St.
Beuve has left models in French, in this respect, which we
should do well to imitate. We Americans are a good-natured
set, and our criticism inclines to comity and good-fellowship
far more than to the rude bluntness of our English
neighbors; and if we could make this discriminating,
as well as urbane, we should get about the right thing."</p>

<p>Our conversation was interrupted here by Jim Fellows,
who came thundering up-stairs, singing at the top of his
lungs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"If an engine meet an engine</div>

<div class="verse">Not a penny&mdash;paid to any,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">So far as I observe&mdash;"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>"Gracious, Jim! what a noise!" said I, as he entered the
room with a perfect war-whoop on the chorus.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, man, why arn't you dressing? Arn't
you going up to the garden of Eden with me to night, to
see the woman, and the serpent, and all that?" he said, collaring
me without ceremony. "Come away to your bower,
and curl your nut-brown hair; for</p>

</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus singing, Jim whirled me down the stairs, and tumbled
me into my room, and went into his, where I heard him
accompanying his toilet operations with very loud selections
from the last comic opera, beating time with his hair-brush
in a bewildering manner.</p>

<p>Jim was certainly a natural curiosity in respect to the
eternal, unceasing vivacity of his animal spirits, which
were in a state of effervesence from morning to night, frothing
out in some odd freak of drollery or buffoonery. There
was not the smallest use in trying remonstrance or putting
on a sober face; his persistence, and the endless variety of
his queer conceits, would have overcome the gravity of the
saddest hermit that ever wore sackcloth and ashes.</p>

<p>Bolton had become accustomed to see him bursting
into his room at all hours, with a breeze which fluttered all
his papers; and generally sat back resignedly in his chair,
and laughed in helpless good-nature, no matter how untimely
the interruption. "Oh, it's Jim!" he would say,
in tones of comic resignation. "It's no use; he must have
his fling!"</p>

<p>"Time's up," said Jim, drumming on my door with his
hair-brush when his toilet was completed. "Come on,
my boy, 'Let us haste to Kelvyn Grove.'"</p>

<p>I opened my door, and Jim took a paternal survey of me
from neck-cloth to boot-toe, turning me round and inspecting
me on all sides, as if I had been a Sunday-school boy,
dressed for an exhibition.</p>

<p>"Those girls have such confounded sharp eyes," he remarked,
"a fellow needs to be well got up. Yes, you'll
do; and you're not bad looking, Hal, either, all things considered,"
he added, encouragingly. "Come along. I've got
lots of things to make a sensation with among the girls to-night."</p>

<p>"What, for example?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been investigating round, and know sundry
little interesting particulars as to the new engagement just
declared. I know when the engagement ring was got, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
what it cost, and where the bride's jewels are making up,
and what they are to be&mdash;all secrets, you understand, of the
very deadest door-nail kind. But Jim knows them! Oh,
yes!&mdash;you'll see the flutter I'll make in the roost to-night!
I say, if you want to cultivate your acquaintance with
Miss Eva there, I'll draw all the rest off, and keep 'em
so wide awake round me that they'll never think what
becomes of you."</p>

<p>I must confess to feeling not a little nervous in the prospect
of my initiation into society, and regarding with a
secret envy the dashing, easy assurance of Jim. I called
him in my heart something of a coxcomb, but it was with a
half-amused tolerance that I allowed him to patronize me.</p>

<p>The experience of a young man who feels that he has his
own way in life to make, and all whose surroundings must
necessarily be of the most rigid economy, when he enters
the modern sphere of young ladyhood, is like a sudden
change from Nova Zembla to the tropics. His is a world
of patient toil, of hard effort, of dry drudgery, of severe
economies; while our young American princesses, his social
equals, whose society fascinates him, to whose acquaintance
he aspires, live like the fowls of the air or the lilies of the
field, without a thought of labor, or a care, or serious responsibility
of any kind. They are "gay creatures of the
element," living to enjoy and to amuse themselves, to be
fostered, sheltered, dressed, petted, and made to have "good
times" generally. In England, there are <em>men</em> born to just
this life and position,&mdash;hereditary possessors of wealth,
ease, and leisure, and therefore able to be hereditary idlers
and triflers&mdash;to live simply to spend and to enjoy. But in
America, where there are no laws to keep fortunes in certain
families, fortunes, as a general rule, must be <em>made</em> by their
possessors, and young men must make them. The young,
unmarried women, therefore, remain the only aristocracy
privileged to live in idleness, and wait for their duties to
come to them.</p>

<p>The house to which I was introduced that night was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of those New York palaces that are furnished with eclectic
taste, after a survey of all that Europe has to give. The
suites of rooms opened into each other in charming vista,
and the walls were hung with the choicest paintings. It
was evident that cultured skill and appreciation had presided
over the collection of the endless objects of artistic
elegance and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vertu</i> which adorned every apartment: it was
no vulgar display of wealth, but a selection which must
have been the result of study and care.</p>

<p>Jim, acting the part of master of ceremonies, duly presented
me to Mr. and Mrs. Van Arsdel, and the bevy of
young ladies, whose eyes twinkled with dangerous merriment
as I made my bow to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Arsdel was what one so often sees in these palaces,
a simple, quiet, silent man, not knowing or caring a
bodle about any of the wonders of art and luxury with
which his womankind have surrounded him, and not pretending
in the least to comprehend them; but quietly indulgent
to the tastes and whims of wife and daughters, of whose
superior culture he is secretly not a little proud.</p>

<p>In Wall street Mr. Van Arsdel held up his head, and found
much to say; his air was Napoleonic; in short, <em>there</em> his
foot was on his native heath. But in his own house, among
Cuyps, and Frères, and Rembrandts, and Fra Angelicos,
with a set of polyglot daughters who spake with tongues,
he walked softly, and expressed himself with humility, like
a sensible man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Arsdel had been a beauty from her youth;
had come of a family renowned for belles, and was still a
very handsome woman, and, of course, versed in all those
gentle diplomacies, and ineffable arts and crafts, by which
the sons of Adam are immediately swayed and governed.</p>

<p>Never was stately swan sailing at the head of a brood of
fair young cygnets more competent to leadership than she
to marshal her troop of bright, handsome daughters through
the straits of girlhood to the high places of matrimony.
She read, and classified, and ticketed, at a glance, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
young man presented to her, yet there was not a shade of
the scrutiny dimming the bland cordiality of her reception.
She was winning, warming, and charming; fully alive to
the éclat of a train of admirers, and to the desirableness
of keeping up a brilliant court.</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson," she said, with a rich mellow laugh, "I
tell Eva there is some advantage, first or last, in almost
everything. One of her scatter-brained tricks has brought
us the pleasure of your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Mamma has such a shocking way of generalizing about
us girls," said Eva; "If we once are caught doing a thing
she talks as if we made a regular habit of it. Now, I have
come over from Brooklyn hundreds of times, and never
failed to have the proper change in my purse till this once."</p>

<p>"I am to regard it, then, as a special piece of good fortune,
sent to <em>me</em>?" said I, drawing somewhat nearer, as
Mrs. Van Arsdel turned to receive some new arrivals.</p>

<p>I had occasion this evening to admire the facility with
which Jim fulfilled his promise of absorbing to himself the
attention of the young hostesses, and leaving me the advantage
of a tête-à-tête with my new acquaintance. I could
see him at this moment, seated by Miss Alice, a splendid,
brilliant brunette, while the two pretty younger sisters,
not yet supposed to be out, were seated on ottomans, and
all in various stages of intense excitement. I could hear:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Fellows, now, you <em>must</em> tell us! indeed I am
quite wild to know! how <em>could</em> you find it out?" in various,
eager tones. Jim, of course, was as fully aware of the
importance of a dramatic mystery as a modern novel-writer,
and pursued a course of most obdurate provocation, letting
out only such glimpses and sparkles of the desired
intelligence as served to inflame curiosity, and hold the
attention of the circle concentrated upon himself.</p>

<p>"I think you are perfectly dreadful! Oh, Mr. Fellows,
it really is a shame that you don't tell us, really now I shall
break friendship with you,"&mdash;the tones here became threatening.
Then Jim struck a tragic attitude, and laid his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
on his heart, and declared that he was a martyr, and
there was more laughing and such a chatter, and confusion
of tongues, that nothing definite could be made out.</p>

<p>The length of time that young people, from eighteen
to twenty, and even upward, can keep themselves in ecstacies
of excitement with such small stock of real things of
any sort to say, is something that invariably astonishes
old and sober people, who have forgotten that they once
were in this happy age, when everything made them laugh.
There was soon noise enough, and absorption enough,
in the little circle,&mdash;widened by the coming in of one or two
other young men&mdash;to leave me quite unnoticed, and in the
background. This was not to be regretted, as Miss Eva
assumed with a charming ease and self-possession that rôle
of hospitality and entertainment, for which I fancy our
young American princess has an especial talent.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Henderson," she said, "we scarcely
expected you, as we hear you never go out."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! your friend, Mr. Fellows there, has presented
you to us in most formidable aspects&mdash;such a Diogenes! so
devoted to your tub! no getting you out on any terms!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure," I answered, laughing, "I wasn't aware that
I had ever had the honor of being discussed in your circle
at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, Mr. Henderson, you gentlemen who make
confidants of the public are often known much better than
you know. I have felt acquainted with many of your
thoughts for a long while."</p>

<p>What writer is insensible to such flattery as this? especially
from the prettiest of lips. I confess I took to this sort of
thing kindly, and was ready if possible for a little more of
it. I began to say to myself how charming it was to find
beauty and fashion united with correct literary taste.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, as the rooms were rapidly filling, "let
me show you if I have not been able to read aright some of
your tastes. Come into what I call my 'Italy.'" She lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portiére</i> and we stepped into a charming little boudoir,
furnished in blue satin, whose walls were finished in compartments,
in each of which hung a copy of one of Fra
Angelico's Angels. Over the white marble mantel was a superb
copy of "The Paradise." "There," she said, turning
to me, with a frank smile, "am I not right?"</p>

<p>"You are, indeed, Miss Van Arsdel. What beautiful
copies! They take me back to Florence."</p>

<p>"See here," she added, opening a velvet case, "here is
something that I know you noticed, for I read what you
thought of it."</p>

<p>It was an exquisite copy of that rarest little gem of Fra
Angelico's painting, "The Death-Bed of the Virgin Mary,"&mdash;in
time past the theme of some of my verses, which Miss
Van Arsdel thus graciously recalled.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said, "the only drawback when one
reads poems that exactly express what one would like to
say, is that it makes us envious; one thinks, why couldn't <em>I</em>
have said it thus?"</p>

<p>"Miss Van Arsdel," said I, "do you remember the lines of
Longfellow: 'I shot an arrow through the air?'"</p>

<p>"What are they?" she said.</p>

<p>I repeated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
	<div class="verse indent1">"I shot an arrow into the air,</div>
	<div class="verse">It fell to earth, I knew not where;</div>
	<div class="verse">For, so swiftly it flew, the sight</div>
	<div class="verse">Could not follow it in its flight.</div>
	</div>
<div class="stanza">
	<div class="verse indent1">"I breathed a song into the air,</div>
	<div class="verse">It fell to earth, I knew not where;</div>
	<div class="verse">For who has sight so keen and strong,</div>
	<div class="verse">That it can follow the flight of song?</div>
	</div>
<div class="stanza">
	<div class="verse indent1">"Long, long afterward, in an oak</div>
	<div class="verse">I found the arrow, still unbroke;</div>
	<div class="verse">And the song, from beginning to end,</div>
	<div class="verse">I found again in the heart of a friend."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>"Do you know," I said, "that this expresses exactly what
a poet wants? It is not admiration, it is sympathy. Poems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
are test papers, put in the atmosphere of life to detect this
property; we can find by them who really <em>feel</em> with us; and
those who do, whether near or far, are <em>friends</em>. The making
of friends is the most precious gift for which poetic utterance
is given."</p>

<p>"I don't think," said she, "you should say '<em>make</em> friends'&mdash;friends
are <em>discovered</em>, rather than made. There are people
who are in their own nature friends, only they don't
know each other; but certain things like poetry, music, and
painting, are like the free-mason's signs&mdash;they reveal the
initiated to each other."</p>

<p>And so on we went, deliciously talking and ranging
through portfolios of engravings that took us through
past days; rambling through all our sunny Italian life, up
the Campanile, through the old Duomo; sauntering through
the ilexes of the Boboli Garden; comparing notes on the
pictures in the Pitti and the Belle Arte&mdash;in short, we had
one of that blessed kind of times which come when two
enthusiasts go back together over the brightest and sunniest
passages of their experience.</p>

<p>My head swam; a golden haze was around me, and I was
not quite certain whether I was in the body or not. It
seemed to me that we two must always have known each
other, so very simple and natural did it seem for us to talk
together, and to understand one another. "But," she said,
suddenly checking herself, "if we get to going on all these
things there is no end to it, and I promised sister Ida that I
would present you in her study to-night."</p>

<p>"Seems to me it is so <em>very</em> delightful here!" said I, deprecatingly,
not well pleased to come out of my dream.</p>

<p>"Ah, but you don't know, Mr. Henderson, this proposed
presentation is a special honor. I assure you that this is a
distinction that is almost never accorded to any of our
callers; you must know sister Ida has retired from the
world, and given herself up to the pursuit of wisdom, and
it is the rarest thing on earth that she vouchsafes to care
for seeing any one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should be only too much flattered," said I, as I followed
my guide across a hall, and into a little plainly furnished
study, whose air of rigid simplicity contrasted with the
luxury of all the other parts of the house.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="ph3">THE YOUNG LADY PHILOSOPHER.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_s.jpg" width="60" height="61" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Seated,</span> reading by a shaded study-lamp, was a
young woman of what I should call the Jeanie
Deans order&mdash;one whose whole personal appearance
indicated that sort of compact, efficient union of energy
and simplicity characteristic of the Scottish heroine.
Her hair, of a pretty curly brown, was cut short, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</i> Rosa
Bonheur; her complexion glowed with a sort of a wholesome
firmness, indicative of high health; her large, serious grey
eyes had an expression of quiet resolution, united with
careful observation. Her figure inclined to the short, stout
and well-compacted order, which gave promise of vitality
and power of endurance&mdash;without pretensions to beauty.
There was a wholesome, thoughtful cheerfulness and good
humor in the expression of the face that made it decidedly
prepossessing and attractive.</p>

<p>The furniture of the room, too, was in contrast with all
the other appointments of the house. It was old and worn,
and of that primitive kind that betokened honest and
respectable mediocrity. There was a quaint, old-fashioned
writing-desk, with its array of drawers and pigeon-holes;
there were old slippery wooden arm-chairs, unrelieved by
cushions; while the floor was bare, excepting in front of
the fire, where it was covered by a large square of what New
England housekeepers call rag-carpet. The room, in fact,
was furnished like the sitting-room of an old New England
farm-house. A cheerful, bountiful wood-fire, burning on
a pair of old-fashioned brass andirons, added to the resemblance.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Henderson," said Miss Eva, when I had
been introduced and seated, "you are now in the presence
of Miss Van Arsdel proper. This room is Papa's and Ida's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
joint territory, where their own tastes and notions have
supreme sway; and so you see it is sacred to the memories
of the past. There is all the old furniture that belonged to
papa when he was married. Poor man! he has been pushed
out into grandeur, step by step, till this was all that
remained, and Ida opened an asylum for it. Do you know,
this is the only room in the house Papa cares much for. You
see, he was born on a farm, dear gentleman, and he has an
inveterate yearning after primitive simplicity&mdash;huckleberries
and milk, you know, and all that. Don't this look
like the old 'keeping-room' style?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "it looks like <em>home</em>. I know rooms just
like it."</p>

<p>"But I <em>like</em> these old primitive things," said Ida. "I like
hardness and simplicity. I am sick to death of softness
and perfumed cushions and ease. We women are sweltered
under down beds, and smothered with luxuries, in our modern
day, till all the life dies out of us. <em>I</em> want to live while
I live, and to keep myself in such trim that I can <em>do</em> something&mdash;and
I won't pet myself nor <em>be</em> petted."</p>

<p>"There," said Eva, laughing, "blood will tell; there's the
old Puritan broken loose in Ida. She don't believe any of
their doctrines, but she goes on their track. She's just like
a St. Bernard dog that she brought home once. As soon as
snow came, he was wild to run out and search in it, and used
to run off whole days in the woods, just because his ancestors
were trained to hunt travelers. Ida is as bent on testifying
and going against the world as any old Covenanter."</p>

<p>"The world needs going against," said Ida. "By the
by, Mr. Henderson, you must allow me to thank you for
your article on the 'Woman of our Times,' in the <cite>Milky
Way</cite>. It is bracing, and will do good."</p>

<p>"And I," said Eva, kindling with a sort of flame-like vivacity,
"have been perfectly dying to tell you that you don't
<em>know</em> us fashionable girls, and that we are not, after all,
such poor trash as you seem to think. All the out-of-jointness
of society is not our fault."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"I protest, Miss Eva," said I, astonished at the eagerness
of her manner. "I'm sure I don't know what I have said to
give that impression."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say not. You have only used the good stock
phrases and said the usual things. You reformers and moralists,
and all that have got a way of setting us girls down
as sinners as a matter of course, so that you never think
when you do it. The 'Dolls of fashion,' the 'Butterflies,'
&amp;c., &amp;c., are used to point the moral and adorn the tale.
The girl of the period is the scapegoat for all the naughty
things going. Now, I say the girl of the period isn't a particle
worse than the boy of the period; and I think reformers
had better turn their attention to him."</p>

<p>"But I don't remember," said I, astonished and confused
at the sudden vivacity of this attack, "that I said anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but I do. You see it's the party that's hit that
knows when a blow is struck. You see, Mr. Henderson, it
isn't merely you, but everybody, from the London <cite>Spectator</cite>
down, when they get on their preaching-caps, and come
forth to right the wrongs of society, begin about <em>us</em>&mdash;our
dressiness, our expensiveness, our idleness, our extravagance,
our heartlessness. The men, poor, dear creatures,
are led astray and ruined by <em>us</em>. It's the old story of Adam:
'The woman beguiled me.'"</p>

<p>"You see," said Ida, laughing, "Eva's conscience troubles
her; that's why she's so sensitive."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the truth," said Eva. "I'm <em>in</em> the world, and
Ida has gone out of it; and so she can sit by, all serene, when
hits are made at us, and say, 'I told you so.' But, you see, <em>I</em>
am <em>in</em>, and am all the while sure that about half what they
say of us is true, and that makes me sensitive when they
say too much. But, I insist upon it, it isn't <em>all</em> true; and
if it is, it isn't our fault. We are in the world just as we are
in a railroad-car, and we can't help its carrying us on, even
if we don't like the places it takes us through."</p>

<p>"Unless you get out of it," said Ida.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but it takes courage to get out alone, at some desolate
way station, and set up your tent, and make your way,
and have everybody in the cars screaming remonstrances or
laughing at you. Ida has the courage to do it, but I haven't.
I don't believe in myself enough to do it, so I stay in the
car, and wish I didn't, and wish we were all going a better
way than we do."</p>

<p>"No," said Ida; "women are brought up in a way to
smother all the life out of them. All literature from the
earliest ages teaches them that it is graceful to be pretty
and helpless; they aspire to be superficial and showy. They
are directed to look on themselves as flowers&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">
Gay without toil, and lovely without art,<br />
They spring to cheer the sense, and warm the heart;<br />
Nor blush, my fair, to be compared to these&mdash;<br />
Your best, your noblest mission, is <em>to please</em>."
</p>


<p>"Well," said Eva, flushing, "wasn't it a <em>man</em> that wrote
that? and don't they always misunderstand us? We <em>are</em>
soft&mdash;we <em>are</em> weak&mdash;we <em>do</em> love beauty, and ease, and comfort;
but there is a something in us more than they give
us credit for. Where is that place in Carlyle?" she said,
rising with a hasty impulse, and taking down a volume,
and running rapidly over the leaves&mdash;"Oh, here it is!" and
she read with energy from Carlyle's <cite>Hero Worship</cite>:</p>

<p class="blockquot">'It is a calumny to say that men are nerved to heroic action by ease,
hope of pleasure, recompense&mdash;sugar-plums of any kind&mdash;in this world
or the next. In the meanest mortal there is something nobler. The
poor, swearing soldier, hired to be shot, has his honor of a soldier different
from drill, regulations, and the shilling a day. It is not to taste
sweet things, but to <em>do</em> noble and true things, and vindicate himself
under God's heaven as a God-made man, that the poorest son of Adam
dimly longs. Show him the way of doing that, and the dullest drudge
kindles into a hero.</p>

<p class="blockquot">'They wrong man greatly who say he is to be seduced by ease.
Difficulty, abnegation, martyrdom, death, are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">allurements</i> that act on
the heart of man. Kindle the inner genial life of him, and you have
a flame that burns up all lower considerations.'</p>

<p>"Now," she said, her face glowing, and bringing down her
little fist with emphasis, "<em>that</em> is true of <em>women</em> as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
men. They wrong woman greatly who say she is to be
seduced by ease. Difficulty, abnegation, martyrdom, death,
are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">allurements</i> that act on the heart of woman. Now, Mr.
Henderson, every woman that <em>is</em> a woman, feels this in the
depths of her heart, and it is this feeling suppressed that is
at the bottom of a great deal of unhappiness in woman's
life. You men have your chance to express it&mdash;that is your
great good fortune. You are called to be heroes&mdash;your
hour comes&mdash;but we are buried under eternal common-places
and trifles."</p>

<p>"Yet, Miss Eva," said I, "I don't think we are so very
much better off than you. The life of the great body of <em>men</em>
is a succession of mere ignoble drudgeries, with nothing
great or inspiring. Unless we learn to ennoble the common-place
by a heroic spirit, most of us must pass through
life with no expression of this aspiration; and I think that
more women succeed in doing this than men&mdash;in fact, I think
it is the distinctive prerogative of woman to idealize life by
shedding an ennobling spirit upon its very trifles."</p>

<p>"That is true," she said, frankly; "but I confess it never
occurred to me; yet don't you think it harder to be heroic
in every-day affairs?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but those that can inspire common-place
drudgery with noble and heroic meanings are the true
heroes. There was a carpenter once in Nazareth who
worked thirty years quietly at his bench; but who doubts
that every stroke of that work was inspired and heroic, as
much as the three public years that followed? And there
are women, like him, toiling in poverty&mdash;hard-working
wives, long-suffering mothers, whose every breath is heroic.
There <em>can</em> be no common-place where such noble creatures
live and suffer."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Henderson," said Ida, "heroism can be in any
life that is a <em>work</em>-life&mdash;any life which includes energy and
self-denial. But fashionable life is based on mere love of
ease. All it seeks is pleasurable sensation and absence of
care and trouble, and it starves this heroic capability; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
that is the reason, as Eva says, why there is so much
repressed unhappiness in women. It is the hunger of starving
faculties. What are all these girls and women looking
for? Amusement, excitement. What do they dread more
than anything? Effort, industry, self-denial. Not one of
them can read a serious book through&mdash;not because they
are not able, but because it takes an effort. They read
nothing but serial stories, and if there is much thought in
them, they skip it, to get at the story. All the education
they get in schools lies idle; they do nothing with it, as a
general thing. They neither read, write, nor speak their
French, Italian, or German&mdash;and what is the use of having
got them? Men study languages as a key to literature, and
use literature for some purpose; women study only to forget.
It does not take four languages and all the ologies to
enable them to dance the German and compose new styles
of trimming. They might do all they do equally as well
without these expensive educations as with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There now, you have got sister Ida on her pet topic,"
said Eva, with heightened color; "she will take up her
prophecy now, and give it to us wicked daughters of Zion;
but, after all, it only makes one feel worried and bad, and
one doesn't know what to do. We don't make the world;
we are born into and find it ready made. We find certain
things are customs&mdash;certain things are expected of us&mdash;and
we begin to say A, and then we must say B, and so on
through the whole alphabet. We don't want to say B, but
we must because we have said A. It isn't every one that is
brave and strong enough to know where to stop, and face the
world, and say, 'No, I will not do it.' We must keep step
with our neighbors."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ida, "who is it that says, 'Be not conformed
to the world'?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know," said Eva; "there's the Bible&mdash;there are
all the lessons and prayers and hymns of the Church all
going one way, and our lives all going the other&mdash;<em>all</em> our
lives&mdash;everybody's life&mdash;even nice people's lives&mdash;all go the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
other way; except now and then one. There's our new
rector, now, he is beginning to try to bring us up to live as
the Church directs; but mamma and Aunt Maria, and all
of them, cry out that he is High Church, and going to
Popery, and all that; they say that if one is to live as he
says, and go out to prayers morning and evening, and to
Holy Communion every Sunday, it will just upset our whole
plan of life, that one might as well go into a convent&mdash;and
so it will. One can't be in parties all night, and go to
prayers every morning; one can't go through that awful
Holy Communion every Sunday, and live as we generally
do through the week. All our rector is trying to do, is
simply to make a <em>reality</em> of our profession; he wants us to
carry out in good faith what is laid down in the Prayer-book;
but you see we can't do it without giving up the
world as we have it arranged now. For my part, I'm going
to the daily services in Lent, if I don't any other time,
and though it does make me feel dreadfully wicked and
uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor child!" said Ida; "why haven't you
strength to do as you please?"</p>

<p>"Why haven't I the arm of a blacksmith? why can't I
walk ten miles? There are differences of power in mind
as well as body," said Eva.</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted at this moment by Mr.
Van Arsdel, who entered quietly, with his spectacles and
newspapers.</p>

<p>"The children are having lively times in there," he said,
"and I thought I'd just come here and sit where it's quiet,
and read my papers."</p>

<p>"Papa says that every evening," said Eva.</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is, Mr. Henderson," said he, with a confiding
sort of simplicity, "Ida and I feel at home in here,
because it's just the little old place wife and I had when
we began. You see, these are all my old things that we
first went to housekeeping with, and I like them. I didn't
want to have them sent off to auction, if they are old and
clumsy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he should have them, so he should, Pa-sey dear," said
Eva, caressingly, putting her arm round his neck. "But
come, Mr. Henderson, I suppose the gay world outside will
expect us."</p>

<p>I had risen and was looking over the library. It was
largely composed of modern scientific and physiological
works.</p>

<p>"You see my light reading," said Ida, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Ida's books are a constant reproach to me," said Eva;
"but I dip in now and then, and fish up some wonderful
pearl out of them; however, I confess to just the fatal laziness
she reprobates&mdash;I don't go <em>through</em> anything."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Henderson, we won't keep you from the world
of the parlors," said Ida; "but consider you have the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</i>
here whenever you want a quiet talk; and we will be
friends," she said, stretching out her hand with the air of a
queen.</p>

<p>"You honor me too much, Miss Van Arsdel," said I.</p>

<p>"Come now, Mr. Henderson, we can't allow our principal
literary lion to be kept in secret places," said Miss Eva.
"You are expected to walk up and down and show yourself;
there are half a dozen girls to whom I have promised
to present you."</p>

<p>And in a moment I found myself standing in a brilliant
circle of gay tropical birds of fashion, where beauty, or
the equivalent of beauty, charmingness, was the rule, and
not the exception. In foreign lands, my patriotic pride
had often been fed by the enthusiasm excited by my countrywomen.
The beauty and grace of American women
their success in foreign circles, has passed into a proverb;
and in a New York company of young girls one is really
dazzled by prettiness. It is not the grave, grand, noble type
of the Madonna and the <a name="Line_8782">Venus de Milo</a>, but the delicate,
brilliant, distracting prettiness of young birds, kittens,
lambs, and flowers&mdash;something airy and fairy&mdash;belonging
to youth and youthful feeling. You see few that promise to
ripen and wax fairer in middle life; but almost all are like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
delicate, perfectly-blossomed flowers&mdash;fair, brilliant and
graceful, with a fragile and evanescent beauty.</p>

<p>The manners of our girls have been criticised, from the
foreign standpoint, somewhat severely. It is the very nature
of republican institutions to give a sort of unconventional
freedom to its women. There is no upper world of
court and aristocracy to make laws for them, or press down
a framework of etiquette upon them. Individual freedom
of opinion and action pervades every school; it is breathed
in the very air, and each one is, in a great degree, a law unto
herself. Every American girl feels herself in the nobility;
she feels adequate to the situation, and perfectly poised in
it. She dares do many things not permitted in foreign
lands, because she feels strong in herself, and perfectly sure
of her power.</p>

<p>Yet he who should presume on this frank generosity of
manner, will find that Diana has her arrows; and that her
step is free only because she knows her strength, and understands
herself perfectly, and is competent to any situation.</p>

<p>At present, the room was full of that battledore-and-shuttlecock
conversation, in which everything in heaven above
or earth beneath is bantered to and fro, flitting and flying
here and there from one bright lip to another.</p>

<p>"Now, really and truly, girls, are you going to the early
services this Lent? Oh, Mr. Selwyn is such a good man!
and wasn't his pastoral letter beautiful? We really ought
to go. But, girls, I can't get up&mdash;indeed, I can't; do you
know, it's dreadful&mdash;seven o'clock&mdash;only think of it. You
won't go, Eva?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall."</p>

<p>"I lay you a pair of gloves you won't, now," quoth a
mouth, adorned with a long pair of waxed moustaches of a
true Imperial type.</p>

<p>"See if I don't."</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma says I mustn't try," said another; "I haven't
the strength."</p>

<p>"And I tell Eva she can't do it," said Mrs. Van Arsdel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
"Eva is always over-doing; she worked herself to death in
a mission class last year. The fact is, one can't do these
things, and go into society."</p>

<p>"But what's the use of society, mamma?" said Eva.</p>

<p>"Oh, well; we can't all turn into monks and nuns, you
know; and that's what these modern High Church doings
would bring us to. I'm a good, old-fashioned Episcopalian;
I believe in going to church on Sundays&mdash;and that's all we
used to hear about."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Fellows, I saw you at St. Alban's,"
said Miss Alice.</p>

<p>"On your knees, too," said Miss Eva.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in bowing to the altar?" said a third; "I
think it's quite Popish."</p>

<p>"Girls, what are going to be worn for hats this spring?
have you been to Madame De Tullerigs? I declare it's a
shame! but Lent is just the busiest time about one's
clothes, one must have everything ready for Easter, you
know. How do you like the new colors, Mr. Fellows?"</p>

<p>"What! the hell-fire colors?" said Jim.</p>

<p>"Oh, horrors! You dreadful creature, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself!" screamed in four or five voices.</p>

<p>"Am ashamed&mdash;sackcloth and ashes, and all that; eat
nothing but codfish," said Jim. "But that's what they
call 'em, any way&mdash;hell-fire colors."</p>

<p>"I never did hear such a profane creature. Girls, isn't
he dreadful?"</p>

<p>"I say, Miss Alice," said Jim, "do you go to confession
up there? 'Cause, you see, if that thing is getting about, I
think I'll turn priest."</p>

<p>"I think <em>you</em> ought to go to confession," said she.</p>

<p>"I shall in the good times coming, when we have lady
priests."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Henderson, do you believe in women's rights?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, for my part, I have all the rights I want," said Miss
Alice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think you did," said Jim Fellows; "but it's
hard on us."</p>

<p>"Well, I think that is all infidelity," said another&mdash;"goes
against the Bible. <em>Do</em> you think women ought to speak in
public?"</p>

<p>"Ristori and Fanny Kemble, for instance," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;they are speaking other people's words; but
their own?"</p>

<p>"Why not as well as in private?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because&mdash;why, I think it's dreadful; don't you?"</p>

<p>"I can't perceive why. I am perfectly charmed to hear
women speak, in public or private, who have anything good
or agreeable to say."</p>

<p>"But the publicity is so shocking!"</p>

<p>"Is it any more public than waltzing at the great public
balls?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I think lecturing is dreadful; you'll never convince
me. I hate all those dreadful, raving, tearing, stramming
women."</p>

<p>In which very logical and consecutive way the leading
topics of the age were elegantly disposed of; and at eleven
o'clock I found myself out on the pavement with the inexhaustible
Jim, who went singing and whistling by my side
as fresh as a morning blackbird. My head was in a pretty
thorough whirl; but I was initiated into society,&mdash;to what
purpose shall hereafter appear.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap2" src="images/drop_l-quote.jpg" width="70" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="upper-case">"Look</span> there," said Jim Fellows, throwing down a
pair of Jouvin's gloves. "There's from the divine Alice."</p>

<p>"A present?"</p>

<p>"A philopena."</p>

<p>"Seems to me, Jim, you are pushing your fortunes in that
quarter?"</p>

<p>"Yes; having a gay time! Adoring at the shrine and all
that," said Jim. "The lovely Alice is like one of the Madonna
pictures&mdash;to be knelt to, sworn to, vowed to&mdash;but I
can't be the possessor. In the meanwhile, let's have as good
a time as possible. We have the very best mutual understanding.
I am her sworn knight, and wear her colors&mdash;behold!"</p>

<p>And Jim opened his coat, and showed a pretty knot of
carnation-colored ribbon.</p>

<p>"But, I thought, Jim, you talked the other night as if you
could get any of them you wanted?"</p>

<p>"Who says I couldn't, man? Does not the immortal
Shakespeare say, 'She is a woman; therefore to be won'?
You don't go to doubting Shakespeare at this time of day, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then; you see Hal, we get wiser every day&mdash;that
is, I do&mdash;and it begins to be borne in on my mind that these
rich girls won't pay, if you could get them. The game isn't
worth the candle."</p>

<p>"But there is real thought and feeling and cultivation
among them," said I, taking up the gauntlet with energy.</p>

<p>"So there is real juice in hot-house grapes; but if I should
have a present of a hot-house to-morrow, what should I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
have to run it with? These girls have the education of
royal princesses, and all the habits and wants of them; and
what could a fellow do with them if he got them? We
haven't any Parliament to vote dowries to keep them up
on. I declare, I wish you had heard those girls the other
night go on about that engagement, and what they expected
when their time comes. Do you know the steps of getting
engaged?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say I have that happiness," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, first, there's the engagement-ring, not a sign of
love, you understand, but a thing to be discussed and compared
with all the engagement-rings, past, present, and to
come, with Tom's ring, and Dick's ring, and Harry's ring.
If you could have heard the girls tell over the prices of
the different engagement-rings for the last six months, and
bring up with Rivington's, which, it seems, is a solitaire
worth a thousand! Henceforth nothing less is to be thought
of. Then the wedding present to your wife. Rivington
gives $30,000 worth of diamonds. Wedding fees, wedding
journey to every expensive place that can be thought of,
you ought to have a little fortune to begin with. The
lovely creatures are perfectly rapacious in their demands
under these heads. I heard full lists of where they were
going and what they wanted to have. Then comes a house,
in a fashionable quarter, to the tune of fifty thousand dollars;
then furniture, carriages, horses, opera-boxes. The
short of the matter is, old Van Arsdel's family are having a
jolly time on the income of a million. There are six of
them, and every one wants to set up in life on the same income.
So, you see, the sum is how to divide a million so
as to make six millions out of it. The way to do it is plain.
Each son and daughter must marry a million, and get as
much of a man or woman with it as pleases heaven."</p>

<p>"And suppose some of them should love some <em>man</em>, or
woman, more than gold or silver, and choose love in place of
money?" said I.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jim, "that's quite supposable; any of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
girls is capable of it. But after all, it would be rough on a
poor girl to take her at her word. What do they know
about it? The only domestic qualification the most practical
of them ever think of attaining, is how to make sponge-cake.
I believe, when they are thinking of getting married,
they generally make a little sponge-cake, and mix a salad
dressing, that fits them for the solemn and awful position of
wife and mother, which you hear so much about. Now, the
queenly Alice is a splendid girl, and can talk French and
German and Italian; but her knowledge of natural history
is limited. I imagine she thinks gloves grow in packs on
the trees, and artificial flowers are raised from seed, and
dresses develop by uniform laws of nature at the rate of
three or four a month. If you could get the darling to fly to
your arms, and the old gentleman should come 'round, and
give her what he could afford, how could you console her
when she finds out the price of gloves and gaiter-boots, and
all the ordinary comforts? I'm afraid the dear child will
be ready to murder you for helping her to her own way.
So you see, <em>Jim</em> doesn't invest in engagement-rings this
year."</p>

<p>Thereupon I sung:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"A sly old fox one day did spy,</div>
	  <div class="verse">A bunch of grapes that hung so high," &amp;c.</div>
	</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Sing away, my good fellow," said Jim. "Maybe I am
the fox; but I'm a fox that has cut his eye-teeth. I'm too
cute to put my neck in that noose, you see. No, sir; you
can mention to Queen Victoria that if she wants Jim Fellows
to marry one of her daughters, why Parliament has got
to come down handsomely with dowry to keep her on.
They are worth keeping, these splendid creations of nature
and art; but it takes as much as to run a first-class steamer.
They go exactly in the line of fine pictures and statuary,
and all that. They may be adorable and inspiring, and exalting
and refining and purifying, the very poetry of existence,
the altogether lovely; but, after all, it is only the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that can afford to keep them. A wife costs more in our day
than a carriage or a conscience, and both those are luxuries
too expensive for Jim."</p>

<p>"Jim! Jim!! Jim!!!" I exclaimed, in tones of expostulation;
but the impracticable Jim cut a tall pirouette, and
sung,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The crescendo here made the papers flutter, and created a
lively breeze in the apartment.</p>

<p>"And now, farewell, divinest Alice, Jim must go to work.
Let's see. Oh! I've promised a rip-staving skinner on Tom
Brown in that Custom House affair."</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> that business? What has Brown done? If all is
true that is alleged he ought to be turned out of decent
society."</p>

<p>"Oh pshaw! you don't understand; its nothing but a dust
we're kicking up because its a dry time. Brown's a good
fellow enough, I dare say, but you know we want to sell our
papers and these folks want hot hash with their breakfast
every morning, and somebody has got to be served up. You
see the <cite>Seven Stars</cite> started this story, and sold immensely,
and we come in on the wave; the word to our paper is
'pitch in' and so I'm pitching in."</p>

<p>"But, Jim, is it the fair thing to do when you don't
know the truth of the story?"</p>

<p>"The truth! well, my dear fellow, who knows or cares
anything about truth in our days? We want to sell our
papers."</p>

<p>"And to sell your papers you will sell your honor as
a man and a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh! bother, Hal, with your preaching."</p>

<p>"But, Jim, you ought to examine both sides and know the
truth."</p>

<p>"I do examine; generally write on both sides when these
rows come on. I'm going to defend Brown in the <cite>Forum</cite>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
you see they sent round yesterday for an article, so you see
Jim makes his little peculium both ways."</p>

<p>"Jim, is that the square thing?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It would puzzle the Devil himself to make out
what the truth is in one of our real double and twisted New
York newspaper rows. I don't pretend to do it, but I'll
show up either side or both sides if I'm paid for it. We
young men must live! If the public must have spicery we
must get it up for them. We only serve out what they
order. I tell you, now, what this great American people
wants is a semi-occasional <em>row</em> about something, no matter
what; a murder, or a revival, or a great preacher, or the
Black Crook; the Lord or the Devil, anything to make matters
lively, and break up the confounded dull times round
in the country."</p>

<p>"And so you get up little personal legends, myths, about
this or that man?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, that's what public men are good for. They are
our drums and tamborines; we beat on 'em to amuse the
people and make a variety; nobody cares for anything
more than a day; they forget it to-morrow, and something
else turns up."</p>

<p>"And you think it right," said I, "to use up character
just as you do boot-blacking to make your boots shine?
How would you like to be treated so yourself?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't mind it a bit&mdash;Bless your buttons&mdash;it don't hurt
anybody. Nobody thinks the worse of them. Why, you
could prove conclusively that any of our public men break
the whole ten commandments at a smash&mdash;break 'em for
breakfast, dinner and supper, and it wouldn't hurt 'em.
People only oh and ah and roll up their eyes and say "Terrible!"
and go out and meet him, and it's "My dear fellow
how are you? why haven't you been round to our house
lately?" By and by they say, "Look here, we're tired of
this about Brown, give us more variety." Then Jones turns
up and off go the whole pack after Jones. That keeps
matters lively, you see."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>I laughed and Jim was perfectly satisfied. All that he
ever wanted in an argument was to raise a laugh, and he
was triumphant, and went scratching on with his work with
untiring industry. He always left me with an uneasy feeling,
that by laughing and letting him alone I was but half
doing my duty, and yet it seemed about as feasible to
present moral considerations to a bob-o-link.</p>

<p>"There," he said, after half an hour of scribbling,
"there's so much for old Mam."</p>

<p>"Who's old 'Mam'?"</p>

<p>"Haven't heard! why, your mistress and mine, the old
Mammon of unrighteousness; she is mistress of all things
here below. You can't even carry on religion in this world
but through her. You must court old Mam, or your
churches, and your missions, and all the rest go under, and
Jim works hard for her, and she owes him a living."</p>

<p>"There have been men in our day who prevailed in
spite of her."</p>

<p>"Who, for example?"</p>

<p>"Garrison."</p>

<p>"Well, he's top of the heap now, sure enough, but I tell
you that was a long investment. Jim has to run on ready
cash and sell what's asked for now. I stand at my counter,
"Walk up, gentlemen, what'll you take; orders taken and
executed with promptness and despatch. Religion? yes sir.
Here's the account of the work of Divine grace in Skowhegan;
fifty awakened and thirty-nine indulging in hope.
Here's criticism on Boanerges' orthodoxy, showing how he
departs from the great vital doctrines of grace, giving up
Hell and all the other consolations of our holy religion.
We'll serve you out orthodoxy red hot. Anything in this
line? Here's the latest about sweet little Dame Aux Camelias,
and lovely little Kitty Blondine.</p>

<p class="center">
'Oh! Kitty is my darling, my darling, my darling, etc.'
</p>

<p>And here's the reformatory, red hot, hit or miss, here's for
the niggers and the paddies and the women and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
enslaved classes. Jim will go it for any of them, only give
him his price." I think of getting up a show bill with list of
prices affixed. Jim will run anybody up or run anybody
down to order."</p>

<p>I put my hand over his mouth. "Come, you born magpie,"
said I, "you shan't make yourself out so much worse than
you are."</p>

<p class="mt2">[Eva Van Arsdel to Isabel Convers.]</p>

<p><i>My Dear Belle</i>:&mdash;I told you I would write the end of my
little adventure, and whether the "hermit" comes or not.
Yes, my dear, sure enough, he did come, and mamma and
we all like him immensely; he had really quite a success
among us. Even Ida, who never receives calls, was gracious
and allowed him to come into her sanctum because he is a
champion of the modern idea about women. Have you seen
an article in the "<cite>Milky Way</cite>" on the "Women of our
Times," taking the modern radical ground? Well, it was
by him; it suited Ida to a hair, but some little things in
it vexed me because there was a phrase or two about the
"fashionable butterflies," and all that; that comes a great
deal too near the truth to be altogether agreeable. I don't
care when Ida says such things, because she's another
woman, and between ourselves we know there <em>is</em> a deal of
nonsense current among us, and if we have a mind to
talk about it among ourselves, why its like abusing one's
own relations in the bosom of the family, one of the sweetest
domestic privileges, you know; but, when lordly man
begins to come to judgment and call over the roll of our
sins, I am inclined to tell him to look at home, and to say,
"Pray, what do you know about us sir?" I stand up for my
sex, right or wrong; so you see we had a spicy little controversy,
and I made the hermit open his eyes, (and, between
us, he has handsome eyes to open). He looked innocently
astonished at first to be taken up so briskly, and called to
account for his sayings. You see the way these men have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of going on and talking without book about us quite blinds
them; they can set us down conclusively in the abstract
when they don't see us or hear us, but when a real live girl
meets them and asks an account of their sayings they
begin to be puzzled. However, I must say my lord <em>can</em>
talk when he fairly is put up to it. He is a true, serious,
earnest-hearted man, and does talk beautifully, and his
eyes speak when he is silent. The forepart of the evening,
you see we were in a state of most charming agreement;
he was in our little "Italy," and we had the nicest
of times going over all the pictures and portfolios and the
dear old Italian life; it seems as if we had both of us seen,
and thought of, and liked the same things&mdash;it was really
curious!</p>

<p>Well, like enough, that's all there is to it. Ten to one he
never will call again. Mamma invited him to be here every
Wednesday, quite urged it upon him, but he said his time
was so filled up with <em>work</em>. There you see is where men
have the advantage of girls! They have something definite
to fill up their time, thought and hearts; we <em>nothing</em>, so
we think of them from sheer idleness, and they forget us
through press of business. Ten to one he never calls here
again. Why should he? I shouldn't think he would. <em>I</em>
wouldn't if I were he. He isn't a dancing man, nor an idler,
but one that takes life earnestly, and after all I dare say
he thinks us fashionable girls a sad set. But I'm sure he
must admire Ida; and she was wonderfully gracious <em>for
her</em>, and gave him the entrée of her sanctum, where there
never are any but rational sayings and doings.</p>

<p>Well, we shall see.</p>

<p>I am provoked with what you tell me about the reports of
my engagement to Mr. Sydney, and I tell you now once
again "No, no." I told you in my last that I was not engaged,
and I now tell you what is more that I never <em>can</em>, <em>shall</em>
or <em>will</em> be engaged to him; <em>my mind is made up</em>, but how to
get out of the net that is closing round me I don't see.
I think all these things are "perplexing and disagreeable."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
If a girl wants to do the fair thing it is hard to know how.
First you refuse outright, and then my lord comes as a
friend. Will you only allow him the liberty to try and
alter your feelings, and all that? You shall not be forced;
he only wants you to get more acquainted, and the result is
you go on getting webbed and meshed in day after day
more and more. You can't refuse flowers and attentions
offered by a friend; if you take them you may be quite
sure they will be made to mean more. Mamma and Aunt
Maria have a provoking way of talking about it constantly
as a settled thing, and one can't protest from morning till
night, apropos to every word. At first they urged me to
receive his attentions; now they are saying that I have accepted
so many I can't honorably withdraw. And so he
doesn't really give me an opportunity to bring the matter
to a crisis; he has a silent taking-for-granted air, that is
provoking. But the law that binds our sex is the law of
all ghosts and spirits; we can't speak till we are spoken to;
meanwhile reports spread, and people say hateful things as
if you were trying and failing. How angry that makes me!
One is almost tempted sometimes to accept just to show
that one can; but, seriously, dear Belle, this is wicked trifling.
Marriage is an awful, a tremendous thing, and we of
the church are without excuse if we go into it lightly or
unadvisedly, and I never shall marry till I see the man that
is my fate. I have what mamma calls domestic ideas, and
<em>I'm going to have them</em>, and when I marry it shall be for
the man alone, not a pieced up affair of carriages, horses,
diamonds, opera boxes, cashmeres <em>with</em> a man, but a <em>man</em>
for whom all the world were well lost; then I shall not be
afraid of the church service which now stands between me
and Mr. Sydney. I cannot, I dare not lie to God and swear
falsely at the altar, to gain the whole world.</p>

<p>I wish you could hear our new rector. He is making a
sensation among us. If the life he is calling on us all to
live is the real and true one, we shall soon have to choose
between what is called society, and the church; for if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
being a church-woman means all he says, one cannot be
in it without really making religion the life's business&mdash;which,
you know, we none of us do or have. Dear man,
when I see him tugging and straining to get our old, sleepy,
rich families into heavenly ways, I think of Pegasus yoked
to a stone cart. He is all life and energy and enthusiasm,
he breathes fire, and his wings are spread heavenward, but
there's the old dead, lumbering cart at his heels! Poor
man!&mdash;and poor cart too&mdash;for I am in it with the rest of the
lumber!</p>

<p>We are in all the usual Spring agonies now about clothes.
The house reverberates with the discussion of hats and
bonnets, and feathers and flowers, and overskirts and underskirts,
and all the paraphernalia&mdash;and what an absurd combination
it makes with the daily services in Lent. Absurd?
No&mdash;<em>dreadful!</em> for at church we are reading of our Saviour's
poverty and fasting and agonies&mdash;what a contrast between
his life and ours! Was it to make us such as we are that he
thus lived and died?</p>

<p>Cousin Sophia is happy in her duties in the sisterhood.
Her church life and daily life are all of a piece&mdash;one part is
not a mockery of the other. There's Ida too&mdash;out of the
church, making no profession of churchly religion, but living
wholly out of this bustling, worldly sphere, devoted to a
noble life purpose&mdash;fitting herself to make new and better
paths for women. Ida has none of these dress troubles;
she has cut loose from all. Her simple black dress costs
incredibly less than our outfit&mdash;it is all arranged <em>with a purpose</em>&mdash;yet
she always has the air of a lady, and she has besides
a real <em>repose</em>, which we never do. This matter of
dress has a thousand jars and worries and vexations to a fastidious
nature; one wishes one were out of it.</p>

<p>I have heard that nuns often say they are more blessed
than ever they were in the world, and I can conceive why,&mdash;it
is a perfect and blissful rest from all that troubles ordinary
women. In the first place, the marriage question.
They know that they are not to be married, and it is a comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to have a <em>definite</em> settlement of that matter. Then all
agitations and fluctuations about <em>that</em> are over. In the
next place, the dress question. They have a dress provided,
put it on, and wear it without thought or inquiry;
there is no room for thought, or use for inquiry. In the
third place, the question of sphere and work is settled for
them; they know their duties exactly; and if they don't,
there is a director to tell them; they have only to obey.
This must be rest&mdash;blissful rest.</p>

<p>I think of it sometimes, and wonder why it is that this
dress question must smother us women and wear us out,
and take our whole life and breath as it does! In our
family it is perfectly fearful. If one had only one's self
to please, it is hard enough&mdash;what with one's own fastidious
taste, with dressmakers who never keep their word, and
push you off at the last moment with abominable things;
but when one has pleased one's self, then comes mamma,
and then all the girls, every one with an opinion; and
then when this gauntlet is run, comes Aunt Maria, more
solemn and dictatorial than the whole&mdash;so that by the time
anything gets really settled, one is so fatigued that life
doesn't seem really worth having.</p>

<p>I told Mr. Henderson, in our little discussion last night,
that I envied <em>men</em> because they had a chance to live a real,
grand, heroic life, while we were smothered under trifles
and common-places, and he said, in reply, that the men had
no more chances in this way than we; that theirs was a
life of drudgeries and detail; and that the only way for
man or woman was to animate ordinary duties by a heroic
spirit. He said that woman's speciality was to idealize life
by shedding a noble spirit upon its ordinary trifles. I don't
think he is altogether right. I still think the opportunities
for a noble life are ten to one in the hands of men;
but still there is a great deal in what he says. He spoke
beautifully of the noble spirit shown by some women in
domestic life. I thought perhaps it was his mother he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
thinking of. He must have known some noble woman, for
his eye kindled when he spoke about it.</p>

<p>How I have run on&mdash;and what a medley this letter is. I
dare not look it over, for I should be sure to toss it into
the fire. Write to me soon, dearest Bella, and tell me what
you think of matters so far.</p>

<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I</span> have often had occasion to admire the philosophical
justice of popular phrases. The ordinary
cant phraseology of life generally represents a
homely truth because it has grown upon reality like a lichen
upon a rock. "Falling in love" is a phrase of this kind; it
represents just that phenomenon which is all the time happening
among the sons and daughters of Adam in most unforeseen
times and seasons, and often when the subject least
intends it, and even intends something quite the contrary.</p>

<p>The popular phrase "falling in love" denotes something
that comes unexpectedly. One may walk into love preparedly,
advisedly, with the eyes of one's understanding open;
but one <em>falls in</em> love as one falls down stairs in a dark entry,
simply because the foot is set where there is nothing for
it to stand on, which I take to be a simile of most philosophical
good resolutions.</p>

<p>I flattered myself at this period of my existence, that I
was a thorough-paced philosopher; a man that had outlived
the snares and illusions of youth, and held himself and all
his passions and affections under most perfect control.</p>

<p>The time had not yet come marked out in my supreme
wisdom for me to meditate matrimonial ideas: in the mean
while, I resolved to make the most of that pleasant and convenient
arbor on the Hill Difficulty which is commonly
called Friendship.</p>

<p>Concerning this arbor I have certain observations to
make. It is most commodiously situated, and commands
charming prospects. We are informed of some, that on a
clear day one can see from it quite plainly as far as to the
Delectable Mountains. From my own experience I have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
doubt of this fact. For a young man of five-and-twenty or
thereabouts, not at present in circumstances to marry, what
is more charming than to become the intimate friend in a
circle of vivacious and interesting young ladies, in easy
circumstances, who live in a palace surrounded by all the
elegancies, refinements, and comforts of life?</p>

<p>More blissful still, if he be welcomed to these bowers of
beauty by a charming and courteous mamma who hopes
he will make himself at home, and assures him that they
will treat him quite as one of the family. This means, of
course, that perfect confidence is reposed in his discretion.
He is labeled&mdash;"Safe." He is to gaze on all these charms,
with a disinterested spirit, without a thought of personal
appropriation. Of course he is not to stand in the way of
eligible establishments that may offer, but meanwhile he
can make himself generally agreeable and useful. He may
advise the fair charmers as to their reading and superintend
the cultivation of their minds; he may be on hand
whenever an escort is needed to a party, he may brighten
up dull evenings by reading aloud, and in short may be
that useful individual that is looked on "quite as a brother,
you know."</p>

<p>Young men who glide into this position in families,
generally, I believe, enjoy it quite as much as the moth-millers
who seem to derive such pleasure from the light
and beat of the evening lamp, and with somewhat similar
results. But though thousands of these unsophisticated
insects singe their wings every evening, the thousand-and-first
one comes to the charge with a light heart in his
bosom, and quite as satisfied of his good fortune as I was
when Mrs. Van Arsdel with the sweetest and most motherly
tones said to me, "I know, Mr. Henderson, the lonely life
you young men must lead when you first come to cities; you
have been accustomed to the home circle, to mother and
sisters, and it must be very dreary. Pray, make this a sort
of home; drop in at any time, our parlors are always open,
and some of us about; or if not, why, there are the pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and the books, you know, and there is the library where you
can write."</p>

<p>Surely it was impossible for a young man to turn away
from all this allurement. It was the old classic story:&mdash;</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent1">"The mother Circe with the Syrens three,</div>
	  <div class="verse">Among the flowery kirtled Naïdes."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Van Arsdel, as I said, was one of three fair sisters
who had attained a great celebrity, in the small provincial
town where they were born, for their personal charms. They
were known far and near as the beautiful Miss Askotts.
Their father was a man rather in the lower walks of life, and
the fortunes of the family were made solely by the personal
attractions of the daughters.</p>

<p>The oldest of these, Maria Askott, married into one of the
so-called first New York families. The match was deemed
in the day of it a very brilliant one. Tom Wouverman was
rich, showy, and dissipated; and in a very few years ran
through both with his property and constitution, and left
his wife the task of maintaining a genteel standing on very
limited means.</p>

<p>The second sister, Ellen, married Mr. Van Arsdel when he
was in quite modest circumstances, and had been carried up
steadily by his business ability to the higher circles of New
York life. The third had married a rich Southern planter
whose fortunes have nothing to do with my story.</p>

<p>The Van Arsdel household, like most American families,
was substantially under feminine rule. Mr. Van Arsdel
was a quiet, silent man, whose whole soul was absorbed in
business, and who left to his wife the whole charge of all
that concerned the household and his children.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Arsdel, however, was under the control of her
elder sister. There are born dictators as well as born poets.
Certain people come into the world with the instinct and
talent for ruling and teaching, and certain others with the
desire and instinct of being taught and ruled over. There
are people born with such a superfluous talent for management<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and dictation that they always, instinctively and as
a matter of course, arrange not only their own affairs but
those of their friends and relations, in the most efficient
and complete manner possible. Such is the tendency of
things to adaptation and harmony, that where such persons
exist we are sure to find them surrounded by those who
take delight in being guided, who like to learn and to look
up. Such a domestic ruler was Mrs. Maria Wouverman,
commonly known in the Van Arsdel circle as "Aunt
Maria," a name of might and authority anxiously interrogated
and quoted in all passages of family history.</p>

<p>Now the fact is quite striking that the persons who hold
this position in domestic policy are often not particularly
strong or wise. The governing mind of many a circle is not
by any means the mind best fitted either mentally or morally
to govern. It is neither the best nor the cleverest
individual of a given number who influences their opinions
and conduct, but the person the most perseveringly self-asserting.
It is amusing in looking at the world to see how
much people are taken at their own valuation. The persons
who always have an opinion on every possible subject ready
made, and put up and labeled for immediate use, concerning
which they have no shadow of a doubt or hesitation, are
from that very quality born rulers. This positiveness, and
preparedness, and readiness may spring from a universal
shallowness of nature, but it is none the less efficient. While
people of deeper perceptions and more insight are wavering
in delicate distresses, balancing testimony and praying for
light, this common-place obtuseness comes in and leads all
captive, by mere force of knowing exactly what it wants,
and being incapable of seeing beyond the issues of the
moment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Maria Wouverman was all this. She always believed
in herself, from the cradle. The watchwords of her conversation
were always of a positive nature. "To be sure,"
"certainly," "of course," "I see," and "I told you so."</p>

<p>Correspondingly to this, Mrs. Van Arsdel, her next sister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was one who said habitually, "What would you do, and
how would you do it?" and so the domestic duet was complete.
Mrs. Wouverman did not succeed in governing or
reclaiming her husband, but she was none the less self-confident
for that; and having seen him comfortably into his
grave, she had nothing to do but get together the small
remains of the estate and devote herself to "dear Ellen
and her children." Mrs. Wouverman managed her own
house, where everything was arranged with the strictest
attention and economy, and to the making a genteel appearance
on a small sum, and yet found abundance of time to
direct sister Ellen and her children.</p>

<p>She was a good natured, pleasant-mannered woman, fond
of her nieces and nephews; and her perfect faith in herself,
the decision of all her announcements, and the habitual
attitude of consultation in which the mother of the family
stood towards her, led the Van Arsdel children as they grew
up to consider "Aunt Maria," like the Bible or civil government,
as one of the great ready-made facts of society, to
be accepted without dispute or injury.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wouverman had her own idea of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum bonum</i>,
that great obscure point about which philosophers have
groped in vain. Had Plato or Anaxagoras or any of those
ancient worthies appealed to her, she would have smiled on
them benignantly and said: "Why yes, of course, don't you
see? the thing is very simple. You must keep the best
society and make a good appearance."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Arsdel had been steadily guided by her in the
paths of fashionable progression. Having married into a
rich old family, Aunt Maria was believed to have mysterious
and incommunicable secrets of gentility at her command.
She was always supposed to have an early insight
into the secret counsels of that sublime, awful, mysterious
"<em>they</em>," who give the law in fashionable life. "<em>They</em> don't
wear bonnets that way, now!" "My love, <em>they</em> wear gloves
sewed with colored silks, now!" or, "<em>they</em> have done with
hoops and flowing sleeves," or, "<em>they</em> are beginning to wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
hoops again! <em>They</em> are going to wear long trains," or, "<em>they</em>
have done with silver powder now!" All which announcements
were made with a calm solemnity of manner calculated
to impress the youthful mind with a sense of their
profound importance.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Arsdel followed Aunt Maria's lead with that
unquestioning meekness which is so edifying a trait in our
American gentlemen. In fact he considered the household
and all its works and ways as an insoluble mystery which
he was well pleased to leave to his wife; and if his wife
chose to be guided by "Maria" he had no objection. So
long as his business talent continued yearly to enlarge his
means of satisfying the desires and aspirations of his family,
so long he was content quietly and silently to ascend in the
scale of luxurious living, to have his house moved from
quarter to quarter until he reached a Fifth Avenue palace,
to fill it with pictures and statuary, of which he knew little
and cared less.</p>

<p>Under Aunt Maria's directions Mrs. Van Arsdel aspired to
be a leader in fashionable society. No house was to be so
attractive as her's, no parties so brilliant, no daughters in
greater demand. Nature had generously seconded her
desires. Her daughters were all gifted with fine personal
points as well as a more than common share of that spicy
genial originality of mind which is as a general thing rather
a characteristic of young American girls.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Arsdel had had his say about the education of his
sons and daughters. No expense had been spared. They
had been sent to the very best schools that money could
procure, and had improved their advantages. The consequences
of education had been as usual to increase the difficulties
of controlling the subject.</p>

<p>The horror and dismay of Mrs. Van Arsdel and of Aunt
Maria cannot be imagined when they discovered almost
immediately on the introduction of Ida Van Arsdel into
society that they had on their hands an actual specimen of
the strong minded young woman of the period; a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
who looked beyond shows, who did her own thinking,
and who despised or approved with full vigor without consulting
accepted standards, and was resolutely resolved not
to walk in the ways her pastors or masters had hitherto considered
the only appointed ones for young ladies of good
condition.</p>

<p>To work embroidery, go to parties, entertain idlers and
wait to be chosen in marriage, seemed to a girl who had
spent six years in earnest study a most lame and impotent
conclusion to all that effort; and when Ida Van Arsdel
declared her resolution to devote herself to professional
studies, Aunt Maria's indignation and disgust is not to be
described.</p>

<p>"So shocking and indelicate! For my part I can't imagine
how anybody can want to think on such subjects! I'm sure
it gives me a turn just to look into a work on physiology,
and all those dreadful pictures of what is inside of us! I
think the less we know about such subjects the better;
women were made to be wives and mothers, and not to
trouble their heads about such matters; and to think of
Ida, of all things, whose father is rich enough to keep her
like a princess whether she ever does a thing or not!
Why should <em>she</em> go into it? Why, Ida is not bad looking.
She is quite pretty, in fact; there are a dozen girls with
not half her advantages that have made good matches, but
it's no use talking to her. That girl is obstinate as the
everlasting hills, and her father backs her up in it. Well,
we must let her go, and take care of the others. Eva is my
god-child, and we must at any rate secure something for
her." <em>Something</em>, meant of course a splendid establishment.</p>

<p>The time of my introduction into the family circle was a
critical one.</p>

<p>In the race for fashionable leadership Mrs. Van Arsdel had
one rival whose successes were as stimulating and as vexatious
to her as the good fortune of Mordecai the Jew was to
Haman in Old Testament times.</p>

<p>All her good fortune and successes were spoiled by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
good fortune and successes of another woman, who was sure
to be a little ahead of her in everything that she attempted;
and this was the more trying as this individual began life
with her, and was a sort of family connection.</p>

<p>In days of her youth there was one Polly Sanders, a remote
cousin of the Askotts, who was reputed a beauty by
some. Polly was what is called in New England "smart."
She was one who never lost an opportunity, and, as the vulgar
saying is, could make every edge cut. Her charms were
far less than those of the Misses Askott, and she was in
far more straitened circumstances; but she went at the
problem of life in a sort of tooth-and-nail fashion, which
often is extremely successful. She worked first in a factory,
till she made a little money, with which she put herself
to school&mdash;acquired showy accomplishments, and went
up like a balloon; married a man with much the same
talent for getting along in the world as herself; went to
Paris and returned a traveled, accomplished woman, and
the pair set up for first society people in New York; and
to the infinite astonishment of Mrs. Wouverman, were
soon in a position to patronize her, and to run a race, neck
and neck, with the Van Arsdels.</p>

<p>What woman's Christian principles are adequate to support
her under such trials? Nothing ever impressed Aunt
Maria with such a sense of the evils of worldliness as Polly
Elmore's career. She was fond of speaking of her familiarly
as "Polly;" and recalling the time when she was only a factory-girl.
According to Aunt Maria, such grasping, unscrupulous
devotion to things seen and temporal, had
never been known in anybody as in the case of Polly.
Aunt Maria, of course, did not consider herself as worldly.
Nobody ever does. You do not, I presume, my dear madam.
When your minister preaches about worldly people, your
mind immediately reverts to the Joneses and the Simpsons
round the corner, and you rather wonder how they take it.
In the same manner Aunt Maria's eyes were always being
rolled up, and she was always in a shocked state at something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
these dreadful, worldly, dressy Elmores were doing.
But still they went on from conquering to conquer. Mrs.
Elmore was a dashing leader of fashion&mdash;spoke French like
a book&mdash;was credibly reported to have skated with the
Emperor at the Bois de Boulogne&mdash;and, in short, there was
no saying what feathers she didn't wear in her cap.</p>

<p>The Van Arsdels no sooner did a thing than the Elmores
did more. The Van Arsdels had a house in Fifth Avenue;
the Elmores set up a French chateau on the Park. The Van
Arsdels piqued themselves on <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recherché</i> society. The Elmores
made it a point to court all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</i> and distinguished
people. Hence, rising young men were of great
value as ornaments to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salons</i> of the respective houses&mdash;if
they had brought with them a name in the literary world,
so much the more was their value&mdash;it was important to
attach them to <em>our</em> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i>, lest they should go to swell the
triumphs of the enemy.</p>

<p>The crowning, culminating triumph of the Elmores was
the engagement, just declared, of Maria, the eldest daughter,
to young Rivington, of Rivington Manor, concerning
which Aunt Maria and Mrs. Van Arsdel were greatly moved.</p>

<p>The engagement was declared, and brilliant wedding
preparations on foot that should eclipse all former New
York grandeurs; and what luminary was there in the Van
Arsdel horizon to draw attention to that quarter?</p>

<p>"Positively, Ellen," said Aunt Maria, "the engagement
between Eva and Wat Sydney <em>must come out</em>. It provokes
me to see the absurd and indelicate airs the Elmores gives
themselves about this Rivington match. It's really in shocking
taste. I'm sure <em>I</em> don't envy them Sam Rivington.
There are shocking stories told about him. They say he is
a perfect <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roué</i>&mdash;has been taken home by the police night
after night. How Polly, with all her worldliness, can make
such an utter sacrifice of her daughter is what <em>I</em> can't see.
Now Sydney everybody knows is a strictly correct man.
Ellen, this thing ought to come out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, dear me, Maria, Eva is such a strange child. She
won't admit that there is any engagement."</p>

<p>"She <em>must</em> admit it, Ellen&mdash;of course she must. It's Ida
that puts her up to all her strange ideas, and will end by
making her as odd as she is herself. There's that new
young man, that Henderson&mdash;why don't we turn him to account?
Ida has taken a fancy to him, I hear, and it's exactly
the thing. Only get Ida's thoughts running that way
and she'll let Eva alone, and stop putting notions into her
head. Henderson is a gentleman, and would be a very
proper match for Ida. He is literary, and she is literary.
He is for all the modern ideas, and so is she. I'm sure,
I go with all my heart for encouraging him. It's exactly the
thing."</p>

<p>And Aunt Maria</p>

<p class="ph3">I DISCOVER THE BEAUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Much</span> has been written lately concerning the doctrine
of friendship between men and women. It is
thought and said by some that there lies an unexplored
territory in our American life, and we have the example
of Madame Récamier set before us to show how perfectly
intimate and devoted a whole circle of manly friends may
be with one fair woman, without detriment or disadvantage
to their domestic ties or hers. The adorable Juliet is
the intimate friend at once of Matthew Montmorenci, the
saint, of Chateaubriand, the poet, and of an indefinite number
of artists and men of letters, all of whom address her
in language of adoration and devotion, and receive from
her affectionate messages in return. Chateaubriand spends
every afternoon with Juliet, and every evening with his
invalid wife, like a devoted and dutiful husband, and this
state of things goes on from year to year without trouble
and without scandal.</p>

<p>It was with some such sublimated precedent in my head
that I allowed myself to yield to the charming temptation
opened to me by my acquaintance with Eva Van Arsdel.
Supposing by Jim's account that she was already engaged,
looking on myself as yet far off from the place where I
could think of marriage, what was there to hinder my
enjoying her society? Of course, there was no possible danger
to myself, and it would be absolute coxcombry to think
that there would be any to her. She, who had been a queen
of fashion, and who had the world under her feet, if she
deigned to think kindly of a poor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</i>, it could surely
lead to nothing dangerous. I might have been warned, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
were wise, by the fact that the night after my first presentation
I lay awake and thought over all she had said,
and counted the days that should intervene before next
Wednesday evening. I would not for the world have had
Jim Fellows divine what was going on within me; in fact I
took as much pains to cajole and pacify and take myself in
as if I had been a third party.</p>

<p>I woke about six o'clock in the dim grey of the next
morning, from a dream in which Eva and I were talking
together, when she seemed so vivid that I started up almost
feeling that I saw her face in the air. Suddenly I heard the
bell of a neighboring church strike the hour, and thought
of what she had said the evening before about attending
morning services.</p>

<p>What was to hinder my going to the church and seeing
her again? There was a brisk morning walk, that was a
good thing, and certainly morning devotion was something
so altogether right and reasonable that I wondered I
never had thought of it before. I dressed myself and
turned out into the streets to seek the little church of
the Holy Sepulcher where the new Rector of whom Eva
had spoken held early Lenten services.</p>

<p>There was something quaint and rather exciting to my
imagination to be one of a small band who sought the
church at this early hour. The sunlight of the rising day
streamed through the painted window and touched with a
sort of glory the white dress of the priest; the organ played
softly in subdued melody, and the words of the morning
service had a sort of touching lovely sound. "Where two
or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in
the midst of them" seemed to come to my thoughts with
new force as I looked on the small number, two or three
in a pew, who were scattered up and down through the
church. She was there in a seat not far from me, shrouded
in a simple black dress and veil, and seemed wholly and entirely
absorbed by her prayer-book and devotions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>As the little company dispersed at the close of the services,
I stood in the door and joined her as she passed out.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Van Arsdel," I said.</p>

<p>She started and looked surprised, and a bright color
flushed in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson! you quite astonish me."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"There are so very few who get out at this hour; and
you, I believe, are not of the church."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by <em>the</em> church, exactly,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Oh," said she, looking at me with a conscious smile, "I
know what everybody means that says <em>the</em> church&mdash;it generally
means <em>our</em> church&mdash;the one that is <em>the</em> church for
us; but you, I think, belong to the Bethany," she added.</p>

<p>"I do," said I, "but I have large sympathies for all others,
particularly for yours, which seems to me in some points
more worthily to represent what a church should be, than
any other."</p>

<p>She looked pleased, and said with warmth, "Mr. Henderson,
you must not judge our church by such very imperfect
specimens as you see among us. We are very unworthy
children of a noble mother; our church has everything in it
to call us to the highest and best life, only we fall far
below her teaching."</p>

<p>"I think I can see," I said, "that if the scheme of living
set forth by the Episcopal Church were carried out with
warmth and devotion, it would make an ideal sort of society."</p>

<p>"It would be a really consecrated life," she said, with
warmth. "If all would agree to unite in daily morning
and evening prayers for instance," she said, "how
beautiful it would be." "I never enjoy reading my Bible
alone in my room as I do to have it read to me here in
church; somehow to me there is a sacred charm about it
when I hear it read there, and then to have friends, neighbors
and families meet and pray together as one, every day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
would be beautiful. I often think I should like to live close
by one of those beautiful English cathedrals where they
have choral services every day, and I would go morning and
evening, but here, in this dreadful, flashy, busy, bustling
New York, there is no such thing, I suppose, as getting any
number of people to agree to daily worship."</p>

<p>"In that respect," said I, "we modern Christians seem
to be less devout than the ancient heathen or the Mohammedans;
you recollect Huju Buba sums up the difference between
the Englishman and the Persian by saying, 'We Persians
pray seven times a day, and they, never.'"</p>

<p>"I like to come to church," she said, "it seems a shelter
and a refuge. Nowadays there are so many things said that
one doesn't know what to think of; so many things disputed
that one has always supposed to be true; such a perfectly
fatiguing rush of ideas and assertions and new ways that
for my part I am glad to fall back upon something old and
established, that I feel sure isn't going to melt away into
mist before to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I can well appreciate that feeling," I said, "for I have
it myself."</p>

<p>"Do you? Oh, Mr. Henderson, you don't know how it
perplexes one. There's sister Ida, now! she has a circle of
friends&mdash;the very nicest sort of people they seem to be!&mdash;but,
dear me! when I am with them a little while, I get
perfectly bewildered. No two of them seem to believe
alike on any subject; and if you quote the Bible to them,
they just open their eyes and look amazed at you, as if
<em>that</em> was something quite behind the age; and as there is no
standard with them, of course there is nothing settled. You
feel as if life was built on water, and everything was rocking
and tilting till you are quite dizzy. Now, I know I am a
poor sort of a specimen of a Christian; but <em>I</em> couldn't live
so! I fly back from this sort of thing, like a frightened bird,
and take refuge in the church&mdash;<em>there</em> is something fixed,
positive, and definite, that has stood the test of time; it is
noble and dignified, and I abide by that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is all that about it," said I; "and so very much
that is attractive and charming in the forms of your church,
that I think if you would only open your arms wide, and
be liberal as the spirit of this age, you would indeed be <em>the</em>
church of the world."</p>

<p>"You think we are not liberal?" she said.</p>

<p>"When you call yourselves <em>the</em> church, and make no
account of all that true, pure, good souls&mdash;true followers of
the same Saviour&mdash;are doing, it seems to me you are not."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, Mr. Henderson, perhaps we are wrong there&mdash;I
cannot say. I know there are many churches and many
dear, good souls in all; it is only to <em>me</em> that mine is <em>the</em>
church; if that is an illusion, it is a happy one."</p>

<p>"Now," said I, "what a dreary picture should we have of
New York Christianity, if we judged it by the few morning
worshipers at Lenten services!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she said. "I am often sorry for our rector&mdash;he
is so earnest, and so few care to come; and yet he told us
in his sermon, last Sunday, that these Lenten services were
an act of union with our Saviour's self-denials and sufferings."</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Van Arsdel," said I, "I doubt not there are
hundreds of thousands in this city who do really, in spirit,
unite with the Saviour in self-denials and sufferings, daily,
who do not express it in this form. If all who really love
the Saviour, and are living in his spirit, <em>should</em> make a point
of early morning service in Lent, I verily believe the
churches would be crowded to overflowing."</p>

<p>"You do really think so?"</p>

<p>"I do. In spite of all that appears, I think ours is really, at
heart, a religious age&mdash;it is only that we do not agree in the
same external forms of expression."</p>

<p>"But how beautiful! oh, how beautiful it would be if we
could!" she said. "Oh, it would be lovely if all the good and
true could see each other, and stand side by side! I long for
<em>visible</em> unity&mdash;and do you think, Mr. Henderson, we could
unite in <em>more</em> beautiful forms than ours?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I do not," said I; "for me, for you, for many like
us, these are the true forms, and the best; but we must
remember that others have just as sacred associations, and
are as dearly attached to other modes of worship as we to
these."</p>

<p>"Then you really do prefer them yourself?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Van Arsdel, I unite with the church of my
father and mother, because I was brought up in it; yet if I
were to choose another, it would be yours."</p>

<p>She looked pleased, and I added: "It seems to me one of
the most beautiful things about it is a daily service."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "and it is pleasant to have churches
where you feel that worship is daily offered, whether people
attend or not. There was something sacred and beautiful
about the Church of St. Peter's in Rome&mdash;to think that at
every hour of day or night worship was going on in it. I
used to like to think of it when I awoke nights&mdash;that they
were praying and adoring there&mdash;in this cold, dreary world;
it seems as if it was like a Father's house, always light, and
warm, and open."</p>

<p>"There is a beauty and use in all these forms and images,"
I said; "and I think if we are wise, we may take comfort in
them all, without being enslaved by any."</p>

<p>Here our interview closed, as with a graceful salutation
she left me at the door of her house.</p>

<p>The smile she gave me was so bright and heart-warm, that
it lightened all my work through the day; a subtle sense of
a new and charming companionship began to shed itself
through all my labors, and, unconsciously and unwatched,
commenced that process of double thought which made
everything I read or wrote suggest something I wanted to
say to her. The reader will not, therefore, wonder that I
proved my sense of the beauty of a daily morning service
by going with great regularity after this, and as regularly
walking home with my enchanting companion.</p>

<p>I was innocently surprised to find how interesting the
morning scenery in prosaic old New York had become. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
was April, and the buds in the Park were swelling, and the
green grass springing in the cracks of the pavement, and
little sparrows twittered and nestled in the ivy that embowered
the church&mdash;and all these things had a strange, new
charm for me. I told myself, every day, that I was not in
love with Eva Van Arsdel, or going to be; I took myself to
witness that all our conversation was on the most correct
and dispassionate subjects, and not in the slightest degree
inclining to any vanity of that nature. Since then, I have
learned that Eva was the kind of woman with whom it
made no difference what the subject matter of conversation
was. It might be religion, or politics, or conic sections, but
the animus of it was sure to be the same thing. It was her
vital magnetism that gave the interest. It was, in fact,
hardly any matter what we talked about, or whether
we talked at all, it was the charm of being together that
made these morning interviews so delightful; though I
believe we discussed nearly everything under the sun, with
the most astonishing unanimity of sentiment.</p>

<p>I was very careful to keep the knowledge of my increasing
intimacy from Jim Fellows. Early rising was not his forte,
and I, very improperly, congratulated myself on the fewness
of the worshipers at early service. By and by, I grew
so conscious that I got a way of stealing out at an opposite
door, appearing to walk off another way, and joining Eva at
the next corner&mdash;lest haply my invariable constancy should
attract attention. She noticed all these things with a droll,
amused, little, half-conscious look. True daughter of Eve
as she was, she had probably seen many a shy fish before,
swimming around her golden net as artlessly as I was doing.</p>

<p>I soon became her obedient slave and servant, interpreting
all her motions and intimations with humble assiduity. Of
course I presented myself duly with Jim in the Wednesday
evening receptions, where, as the rooms were filled with
other company, we already began to practice an involuntary
hypocrisy, keeping up our friendly intimacy by that kind of
intuitive and undemonstrative communication natural to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
those who know each other by sympathy, and learn to
understand each other without words.</p>

<p>I was a great deal in Ida's studio, probably much to
the satisfaction of Aunt Maria and Mrs. Van Arsdel&mdash;while
Eva glanced and twinkled in and out like a fire-fly in a
meadow, taking my heart with her as she came and went,
yet awing me with a dutiful reticence, lest "people should
talk."</p>

<p>Ida was one of those calm, quiet, essentially self-poised
women, with whom it would be quite possible for a man to
have a very intimate friendship, without its toning off into
anything warm, either on her part or on his. Everything
with her was so positive and definite, that there was no
possibility of going over the limits. I think that she really
had a very warm esteem for me; but she looked at me and
judged me solely in relation to Eva, and with a quiet persistency
favored the intimacy that she saw growing between
us. Her plans of life were laid far ahead; she was wedded
to a purpose which she would not have renounced for
any man on earth; but Eva was the very apple of her eye,
and I think she had her own plans as to the settling of her
life's destiny; in short, Ida was from the start the best
friend I could have.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A</span> young man who commences life as a reformer, and
a leader in the party of progress, while saying the
best and most reasonable things in the world, and
advocating what appear to him the most needed reforms,
often finds himself, in consequence, in the condition of one
who has pulled the string of a very large shower-bath. He
wanted cold water, and he gets a deal more than he bargained
for; in fact, often catches his breath, and wonders
when this sort of thing is going to stop. My articles on
the "Modern Woman," in the <cite>Milky Way</cite>, had brought me
into notice in certain enthusiastic circles, and I soon found
myself deluged with letters, appeals, pamphlets, newspapers,
all calling for the most urgent and immediate attention, and
all charging me on my allegiance to "the cause," immediately,
and without loss of time, to write articles for said
papers gratuitously, to circulate said pamphlets, to give
favorable notices of said books, and instantly to find lucrative
situations for hosts of distressed women who were
tired of the humdrum treadmill of home-life, and who
wished to have situations provided where there was no
drudgery and no labor, but <em>very</em> liberal compensation. The
whole large army of the <em>incapables</em>,&mdash;the blind, the halt, the
lame, the weary, and the forlorn,&mdash;all seemed inclined to
choose me as their captain, and to train under my banner.
Because I had got into a subordinate position on the <cite>Great
Democracy</cite>, they seemed to consider that it was my immediate
business to make the <cite>Great Democracy</cite> serve their
wants, or to perish in the attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>My friend, Ida Van Arsdel, was a serious, large-minded,
large-brained woman, who had laid a deep and comprehensive
plan of life, and was adhering to it with a patient and
silent perseverance. Still she had no sympathy in that class
of society where her lot was cast. Her mother and her Aunt
Maria were women who lived and breathed merely in the
opinions of their set and circle, and were as incapable of
considering any higher ideal of life, or any unworldly purpose,
as two canary-birds. Mr. Van Arsdel, a quiet, silent
man, possessed a vein of good sense which led him to
appreciate his eldest daughter at her real worth; and he
was not insensible to the pleasure of having one feminine
companion who, as he phrased it, "understood business,"
and with whom he could talk and advise understandingly.
But even he had no sympathy with those larger views of the
wants and needs of womanhood, in view of which Ida was
acting. It followed very naturally that as Ida got no sympathy
in her own circle, she was led to seek it in the widening
sphere of modern reformers&mdash;a circle in which so much
that is fine and excellent and practical, is inevitably mixed
with a great deal that is crude and excessive.</p>

<p>At her request I accompanied her and Eva one evening to
a sort of New-Dispensation <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i>, which was held weekly
at the house of Mrs. Stella Cerulean. Mrs. Stella Cerulean
was a brilliant woman&mdash;beautiful in person, full of genius,
full of enthusiasm, full of self-confidence, the most charming
of talkers, and the most fascinating of women. Her
career from early life had been one of those dazzling successes
which always fall to the lot of beauty, seconded
by a certain amount of tact and genius. Of both these
gifts Mrs. Cerulean had just enough to bewilder the head
of any gentleman who made her acquaintance. She had
in her girlhood made the tour of Europe, shone as a star
in the courts of France and Russia, and might be excused
for a more than ordinary share of complacency in her
successes. In common with handsome women generally,
she had, during the greater part of her life, never heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
anything but flattery from gentlemen, and it always agreed
with her remarkably well. But Mrs. Cerulean was one of
those women, with just intellect and genius enough to render
her impatient of the mere common-place triumphs of
beauty. She felt the intoxicating power of the personal influence
which she possessed, and aspired to reign in the region
of the mind as well as to charm the senses. She felt
herself called to the modern work of society regeneration,
and went into it with all the enthusiasm of her nature, and
with all that certainty of success which comes from an utter
want of practical experience. Problems which old statesmen
contemplated with perplexity, which had been the
despair of ages, she took up with a cheerful alacrity.</p>

<p>She had one simple remedy for the reconstruction of
society about whose immediate application she saw not
the slightest difficulty. It was simply and only to be
done by giving the affairs of the world into the hands of
women, forthwith. Those who only claim <em>equality</em> for
women were, in Mrs. Cerulean's view, far behind the age.
Woman was the superior sex, the divine sex. Had not
every gentleman of her acquaintance, since she could remember,
told her this with regard to herself? Had they
not always told her that she could know everything without
study, simply by the divine intuitions of womanhood;
that she could flash to conclusions without reasoning, simply
by the brilliancy of her eyes; that her purity was incorruptible
in its very nature; that all her impulses were
heavenly and God-given? Naturally enough, then, it was
her deduction that all that was wanting to heal the woes
and wants of society was that she and other such inspired
beings should immediately take to themselves their power,
and <em>reign</em>.</p>

<p>Such is a general sketch of Mrs. Cerulean's view of the
proper method of introducing the millennium. Meanwhile,
she did her part in it by holding <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salons</i> once a week, in
which people entertaining similar views met for the purpose,
apparently, of a general generation of gas, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
any particular agreement as to the method in which it should
be applied. This was the company of people to whom Eva
rather pathetically alluded in one of her conversations once,
as such nice people, who were so very puzzling to her,
because no two of them ever seemed to think alike on any
subject; and all agreed in opening their eyes very wide in
astonishment if anybody quoted the Bible to them as an
authority in faith and practice.</p>

<p>Ida was much courted and petted by this circle. And
sensible, good girl as she was, she was not wholly without
pleasure in the admiration they showed for her. Then,
again, there were, every evening, ventilated in this company
quantities of the most splendid and heroic ideas possible
to human beings. The whole set seemed to be inspired
with the spirit of martyrdom, without any very precise idea
of how to get martyred effectually. It was only agreed that
<em>everything</em> in the present state of society was <em>wrong</em>, and was
to be pulled down forthwith. But as to what was to come
after this demolition, there were as many opinions in the
circle as there were persons, and all held with a wonderful
degree of tenacity. A portion of them were of opinion that
a new dispensation fresh from the heavenly realms was
being inaugurated by means of spiritualistic communications
daily and hourly conveyed to privileged individuals.
It was, however, unfortunate that these communications
were, very many of them, in point-blank opposition to each
other; so that the introduction of revelations from the invisible
world seemed only likely to make the confusion
worse confounded. Then again, as to all the existing relations
of life, there was the same charming variety of opinion.
But one thing seemed to be pretty generally conceded
among the whole circle, that in the good time coming,
nobody was ever to do anything that he did not want to
do, or feel at the moment just like doing. The great object
of existence apparently was to get rid of everything that
was disagreeable and painful. Thus, quite a party of them
maintained that all marriage relations ought to drop, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the moment that either party ceased to take pleasure in
them, without any regard to the interest of the other party
or the children; because the fundamental law of existence
was happiness&mdash;and nothing could make people happy but
liberty to do just as they had a mind to.</p>

<p>I must confess that I found my evening at Mrs. Cerulean's
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i> a very agreeable one; the conversation of thoroughly
emancipated people has a sparkling variety to it which is
exactly the thing to give one a lively, pleasant evening.
Everybody was full of enthusiasm, and in the very best of
spirits. And there appeared to be nothing that anybody
was afraid to say. Nobody was startled by anything. There
was not a question, as it appeared, that had been agitated
since the creation of the world, that was not still open to
discussion.</p>

<p>As we were walking home after spending an evening,
Ida asked me:</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Henderson, what do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Ida," said I, "after all, I'm a believer in the
old-fashioned Bible."</p>

<p>"What, <em>really</em>, Mr. Henderson?"</p>

<p>"Really and squarely, Miss Ida. And never more so
than when I associate with very clever people who have
given it up. There is, to my mind, a want of common
sense about all theories of life that are not built on that."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ida, "I have long since made up my mind,
for my own part, that if the cause of woman is to be
advanced in this world, it is not so much by meeting together
and talking about it, as by each individual woman
proposing to herself some good work for the sex, and setting
about it patiently, and doing it quietly. That is rather my
idea; at the same time, I like to hear these people talk,
and they certainly are a great contrast to the vapid people
that are called good society. There is a freshness and earnestness
of mind about some of them that is really very
interesting; and I get a great many new ideas."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Eva, "to be sure I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a sad idler, but if I were going to devote myself to any
work for women, it should be in the church, and under the
guidance of the church. I am sure there is something we
can do there. And then, one's sure of not running into all
sorts of vagaries."</p>

<p>"Now," said Ida, "all I want is that women should do
<em>something</em>; that the lives of girls, from the time they leave
school till the time they are married, should not be such a
perfect waste as they now are. I do not profess to be
certain about any of these theories that I hear; but one
thing I do know: we women will bear being made a great
deal more self-sustaining and self-supporting than we
have been. We <em>can</em> be more efficient in the world, and we
ought to be. I have chosen my way, and mean to keep to it.
And my idea is that a woman who really does accomplish a
life-work is just like one that cuts the first path through a
wood. She makes a way where others can walk."</p>

<p>"That's you, Ida," said Eva; "but I am not strong
enough to cut first paths."</p>

<p>I felt a little nervous flutter of her hand on my arm as she
said this. It was in the dark, and involuntarily, I suppose,
my hand went upon hers, and before I thought of it I felt
the little warm thing in my own as if it had been a young
bird. It was one of those things that people sometimes
do before they know it. But I noticed that she did not
withdraw her hand, and so I held it, querying in my
own mind whether this little arrangement was one of the
privileges of friendship. Before I quite resolved this question
we parted at the house-door.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A</span> day or two after, as I was sitting in my room, busy
writing, I heard a light footstep on the stairs, and
a voice saying, "Oh yes! this is Mr. Henderson's
room&mdash;thank you," and the next moment a jaunty, dashing
young woman, with bold blue eyes, and curling brown hair,
with a little wicked looking cap with nodding cock's-feather
set askew on her head, came marching up and seated
herself at my writing-table. I gazed in blank amazement.
The apparition burst out laughing, and seizing me frankly
by the hand, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, Hal! don't you know me? Well, my dear
fellow, if you don't it's time you did! I read your last
'thingumajig' in the <cite>Milky Way</cite>, and came round to make
your acquaintance."</p>

<p>I gazed in dumb amazement while she went on,</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I have come to enlighten you,"&mdash;and as
she said this she drew somewhat near to me, and laid her
arm confidingly on my shoulder, and looked coaxingly in
my face. The look of amazement which I gave, under
these circumstances, seemed to cause her great amusement.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" she said, "didn't I tell 'em so? You ain't half
out of the shell yet. You ain't really hatched. You go
for the emancipation of woman; but bless you, boy, you
haven't the least idea what it means&mdash;not a bit of it, sonny,
have you now? Confess!" she said, stroking my shoulder
caressingly.</p>

<p>"Really, madam&mdash;I confess," I said, hesitatingly, "I
haven't the honor"&mdash;</p>

Confess?' she said, stroking my shoulder caressingly."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Not the honor of my acquaintance, you was going to
say; well, that's exactly what you're getting now. I read <a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"><span class="pagenum">[241]</span></a>
your piece in the <cite>Milky Way</cite>, and, said I, that boy's in
heathen darkness yet, and I'm going round to enlighten
him. You mean well, Hal! but this is a great subject. You
haven't seen through it. Lord bless you, child! you ain't
a woman, and I am&mdash;that's just the difference."</p>

<p>Now, I ask any of my readers, what is a modest young
man, in this nineteenth century,&mdash;having been brought up
to adore and reverence woman as a goddess&mdash;to do, when
he finds himself suddenly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i> with her, in such embarrassing
relations as mine were becoming? I had heard before
of Miss Audacia Dangyereyes, as a somewhat noted
character in New York circles, but did not expect to be
brought so unceremoniously, and without the least preparation
of mind, into such very intimate relations with her.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, bub!" she said, "I'm just a-going
to prove to you, in five minutes, that you've been writing
about what you don't know anything about. You've
been asserting, in your blind way, the rights of woman
to liberty and equality; the rights of women, in short, to do
anything that men do. Well, here comes a woman to your
room who <em>takes</em> her rights, practically, and does just what
a man would do. I claim my right to smoke, if I please, and
to drink if I please; and to come up into your room and
make you a call, and have a good time with you, if I please,
and tell you that I like your looks, as I do. Furthermore,
to invite you to come and call on me at my room. Here's
my card. You may call me 'Dacia, if you like&mdash;I don't go
on ceremony. Come round and take a smoke with me, this
evening, won't you? I've got the nicest little chamber that
ever you saw. What rent do you pay for yours? Say, will
you come round?"</p>

<p>"Indeed&mdash;thank you, miss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call me 'Dacia for short. I don't stand on ceremony.
Just look on me as another fellow. And now confess that
you've been tied and fettered by those vapid conventionalities
which bind down women till there is no strength in
'em. You visit in those false, artificial circles, where women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
are slaves, kept like canary birds in gilded cages.
And you are afraid of your own principles when you see
them carried out in a real free woman. Now, I'm a woman
that not only dares say, but I dare <em>do</em>. Why hasn't a
woman as much a right to go round and make herself
agreeable to men, as to sit still at home and wait for men to
come and make themselves agreeable to her? I know you
don't like this, I can see you don't, but it's only because
you are a slave to old prejudices. But I'm going to <em>make</em>
you like me in spite of yourself. Come, now, be consistent
with your principles; allow me my equality as a woman,
a human being."</p>

<p>I was in such a state of blank amazement by this time as
seemed to deprive me of all power of self-possession. At
this moment the door opened, and Jim Fellows appeared.
A most ludicrous grimace passed over his face as he saw
the position and he cut a silent pirouette in the air, behind
her. She turned her head, and he advanced.</p>

<p>"Fairest of the sex! (with some slight exceptions)&mdash;to
what happy accident are we to attribute this meeting?"</p>

<p>"Hallo, Jim! is this you?" she replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, it's me," said Jim, seating himself familiarly.
"How is the brightest star of womanhood&mdash;the
Northern Light; the Aurora Borealis; the fairest of the
fair? Bless its little heart, has it got its rights yet? Did
it want to drink and smoke? Come along with Jim, now,
and let's have a social cocktail."</p>

<p>"Keep your distance, sir," said she, giving him a slight box
on his ear. "I prefer to do my own courting. I have been
trying to show your friend here how little he knows of the
true equality of women, and of the good time coming, when
we shall have our rights, and do just as we darn please,
as you do. I'll bet now there aint one of those Van Arsdel
girls that would dare to do as I'm doing. But we're opening
the way sir, we're opening the way. The time will come
when all women will be just as free to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, as men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said I, under my breath.</p>

<p>"My beloved Audacia," said Jim, "allow me to remark
one little thing, and that is, that <em>men also</em> must be left free
to the pursuit of happiness, and also, as the Scripture says,
new wine must <em>not</em> be put into old bottles. Now my
friend Hal&mdash;begging his pardon&mdash;is an old bottle, and I
think you have already put as much new wine into him as
his constitution will bear. And as he and I both have got
to make our living by scratching, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tempus fugit</i>, and
we've got articles to write, and there is always, so to speak,
<em>the devil</em> after us folks that write for the press, may I humbly
request that you will withdraw the confusing light
of your bright eyes from us for the present, and, in short,
take your divine self somewhere else?"</p>

<p>As Jim spoke these words, he passed his arm round Miss
Audacia's waist, and drew her to the door of the apartment,
which he threw open, and handed her out, bowing with
great ceremony.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she cried, "I aint going to be put out that way.
I haven't done what I came for. You both of you have
got to subscribe for my paper, <cite>The Emancipated Woman</cite>."</p>

<p>"Couldn't do it, divinest charmer," said Jim, "couldn't
do it; too poor; mill runs low; no water; modest merit
not rewarded. Wait till my ship comes in, and I'll subscribe
for anything you like."</p>

<p>"Well, now, you don't get rid of me that way. I tell you
I came in to get a subscription, and I am going to stay till I
get one," said Miss Audacia. "Come, Hal," she said, crossing
once more to me, and sitting down by me and taking
my hand, "write your name there, there's a good fellow."</p>

<p>I wrote my name in desperation, while Jim stood by,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Jim," I said, "come, put yours down quick, and let's
have it over."</p>

<p>"Well, now," said she, "fork out the stamps&mdash;five dollars
each."</p>

<p>We both obeyed mechanically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well," said she, good naturally, "that'll do for this
time, good morning," and she vanished from the apartment
with a jaunty toss of the head and a nod of the cock's
feathers in her hat.</p>

<p>Jim closed the door smartly after her.</p>

<p>"Mercy upon us! Jim," said I, "who, and what is this
creature?"</p>

<p>"Oh, one of the harbingers of the new millennium," said
Jim. "Won't it be jolly when all the girls are like her?
But we shall have to keep our doors locked then."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "is it possible, Jim, that this is a respectable
woman?"</p>

<p>"She's precisely what you see," said Jim; "whether that's
respectable, is a matter of opinion. There's a woman that's
undertaken, in good faith, to run and jostle in all the ways
that men run in. Her principle is, that whatever a young
fellow in New York could do, she'll do."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said I, "what <em>would</em> the Van Arsdels
think of us, if they should know that she had been in our
company?"</p>

<p>"It's lucky that they don't, and can't," said Jim. "But
you see what you get for belonging to the new dispensation."</p>

<p>"Boys, what's all this fuss?" said Bolton, coming in at
this moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, only Dacia Dangyeeyes has been here," said
Jim, "and poor Hal is ready to faint away and sink through
the floor. He isn't up to snuff yet, for all he writes such
magnificent articles about the nineteenth century."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "it was woman <em>as</em> woman that I was
speaking of, and not this kind of creature. If I believed
that granting larger liberty and wider opportunities was
going to change the women we reverence to things like
these, you would never find me advocating it."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Hal," said Bolton, "be comforted; you're
not the first reformer that has had to cry out, 'Deliver me
from my friends.' Always when the waters of any noble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
generous enthusiasm rise and overflow their banks, there
must come down the drift-wood&mdash;the wood, hay, and stubble.
Luther had more trouble with the fanatics of his day,
who ran his principles into the ground, as they say, than
he had with the Pope and the Emperor, both together. As
to this Miss Audacia, she is one of the phenomenal creations
of our times; this time, when every kind of practical experiment
in life has got to be tried, and stand or fall on its
own merits. So don't be ashamed of having spoken the
truth, because crazy people and fools caricature it. It is
true, as you have said, that women ought to be allowed a
freer, stronger, and more generous education and scope for
their faculties. It is true that they ought, everywhere, to
have equal privileges with men; and because some crack-brained
women draw false inferences from this, it is none
the less true. For my part, I always said that one must
have a strong conviction for a cause, if he could stand the
things its friends say for it, or read a weekly paper devoted
to it. If I could have been made a pro-slavery man, it
would have been by reading anti-slavery papers, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vice
versa</i>. I had to keep myself on a good diet of pro-slavery
papers, to keep my zeal up."</p>

<p>"But," said I, anxiously, to Jim, "do you suppose that
we're going to be exposed to the visits of this young
woman?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jim, "as you've subscribed for her paper,
perhaps she'll let us alone till she has some other point to
carry."</p>

<p>"Subscribe!" said I; "I did it from compulsion, to get
her out of the office; I didn't think the situation respectable;
and yet I don't want her paper, and I don't want my
name on her subscription list. What if the Van Arsdels
should find it out? People are apt enough to think that our
doctrines lead to all sorts of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</i> consequences; and if
Mrs. Wouverman, their Aunt Maria, should once get hold
of this, and it should get all through the circle in which
they move, how disagreeable it would be."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, never fear," said Jim; "I guess we can manage to
keep our own secrets; and as to any of them ever knowing,
or seeing, anything about that paper, it's out of the
question. Bless you! they wouldn't touch it with a pair of
tongs!"</p>

<p class="ph3">AUNT MARIA.</p>


<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a1.jpg" width="60" height="61" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Aunt</span> Maria came into the parlor where Eva and
Alice were chatting over their embroidery. A glance
showed that she had been occupied in that
sensible and time-honored method of keeping up the social
virtues, which is called making calls. She was all plumed
and rustling in flowers and laces, and had on her calling
manners. She had evidently been smiling and bowing and
inquiring after people's health, and saying pretty and obliging
things, till the very soul within her was quite dried
up and exhausted. For it must be admitted that to be
obliged to remember and inquire for every uncle, aunt
and grandmother, every baby, and young master and miss
in a circle of one's three hundred particular friends, is an
exercise of Christian benevolence very fatiguing. Aunt
Maria, however, always went through with it with exhaustive
thoroughness, so that everybody said, What a kind-hearted,
pleasant woman that Mrs. Wouverman is.</p>

<p>"Well, there!" she said, throwing herself into an arm-chair,
"I've nearly cleared my list, thank heaven! I think
Lent is a grand good season to get these matters off your
mind. You know Mr. Selwyn said last Sunday, that it was
the time to bring ourselves up to the disagreeable duties."</p>

<p>"How many have you made, aunty?" said Eva.</p>

<p>"Just three dozen, my dear. You see I chose a nice day
when a good many are sure to be out. That shortens matters
a good deal. Well, girls, I've been to the Elmore's.
You ought to see what a state they are in! In all my experience
I never saw people so perfectly tipped over, and
beside themselves with delight. I'm sure if I were they I
wouldn't show it quite so plain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose," said Alice, "they are quite benignant and
patronizing to us now."</p>

<p>"Patronizing! Well, I wish you could have seen Poll
Elmore and her airs! You would have thought her a duchess
from the Faubourg St. Germain, and no less! She was
so very sweet and engaging! Dear me, she patronized me
within an inch of my life; and 'How are your dear girls?'
she said. 'All the world is expecting to hear some news
of Miss Eva, <em>should</em> we soon have an opportunity of returning
congratulations?'"</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! aunt," said Eva uneasily, "what did you
say?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I told her that Eva was in no hurry, that she was
very reticent of her private affairs, and did not think it in
good taste to proclaim them. 'Ah, then, there really is
something in it,' said she. I was telling my girls perhaps
after all it is mere report; people say so many things.
'The thing was reported about Maria,' she said, 'long
before there was any truth in it'; and then she went on
to tell me how much Maria had been admired, and how
many offers she had rejected, and among other things she
said that Mr. Sidney had been at her disposal,&mdash;only she
couldn't fancy him. 'You know,' she said with a sentimental
air, that 'the <em>heart</em> is all in such cases.'"</p>

<p>"How perfectly absurd of her," said Eva.</p>

<p>"I know," said Alice eagerly, "that Wat Sidney doesn't
like Maria Elmore. She was perfectly wild after him, and
used to behave so that it really disgusted him."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Eva, "all these things are excessively
disagreeable to me; it seems to me where such matters are
handled and talked about and bandied about, they become
like shop-worn goods, utterly disgusting. Who wants every
fool and fop and every gossip who has nothing better to
do talking over what ought to be the most private and delicate
affairs of one's own heart!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, you can't help it in society. Why, every
person where I have called inquired about your engagement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to Wat Sidney. You see you <em>can't</em> keep a thing of
this sort private. Of course you can't. You are in the
world, and the world will have you do as others do. Of
course I didn't announce it, because I have no authority;
but the thing is just as much <em>out</em> as if I had. There was
old Mrs. Ellis, dear old soul, said to me, 'Give my love to
dear Eva, and tell her I hope she'll be happy. I suppose,'
she added, 'I may send congratulations, though it isn't announced.'
Oh, said I, Eva doesn't like to have matters of
this sort talked about."</p>

<p>"But aunty," said Eva, who had been coloring with vexation,
"this is all gratuitous&mdash;you are all engaging and marrying
me in spite of my screams as appears. I am not
engaged to Mr. Sidney, and never expect to be; he is gone
off on a long Southern tour, and I hope out of sight will be
out of mind, and people will stop talking."</p>

<p>"But my dear Eva, really now you ought not to treat a
nice man like him in that way."</p>

<p>"Treat him in what way?" said Eva.</p>

<p>"Why, keep him along in this undecided manner without
giving him a definite answer."</p>

<p>"He might have had a definite answer any time in the
last three months if he had asked for it. It isn't my business
to speak till I'm spoken to."</p>

<p>"You don't mean, Eva, that he has gone off without
saying anything definite&mdash;bringing matters to a point."</p>

<p>"I do mean just that, Aunty, and what's more I'm glad
he's gone, and I hope before he comes back he'll see somebody
that he likes better, and then it'll be all off; and,
Aunty, if any one speaks to you about it you'll oblige me by
saying decidedly there is nothing in it."</p>

<p>"Well, I shan't say there never has been anything in it.
I shall say you refused him."</p>

<p>"And why so? I am not anxious to have the credit of
it, and besides I think it is indelicate when a man has paid
a lady the highest possible compliment he can pay, to make
a public parade of it. Its sufficient to say there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in it and never will be; its nobody's business how it happened."</p>

<p>"Oh, come Eva, don't say there never will be anything
in it. That is a subject on which girls are licensed to
change their minds."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Alice, "I only wish it were I. I'd
have him in a minute. Aunty, <em>did</em> you see that nobby
phæton he was driving the last day he was on the park;
those horses, and that white fur lap-robe, with the long
pluffy hair like silver? I must say, Eva, I think you are
a little goose."</p>

<p>"I've no objection to the park phæton, or horses or lap-robe;
but it isn't those I'm to marry, you see."</p>

<p>"But Eva," said Aunt Maria, "if you wouldn't fancy
such a match as Wat Sidney, who would you? he is a man
of correct and temperate habits, and that's more than you
can say of half the men."</p>

<p>"But a woman doesn't necessarily want to make her most
intimate and personal friend of a man merely because he
doesn't drink," said Eva.</p>

<p>"But he's good looking."</p>

<p>"So they say, but not to me, not my style. In short,
aunty, <em>I don't love him</em>, and never should; and if I were
tied too close to him might end by hating him. As it is, he
and I are the best friends possible. I hope we always shall
stay so."</p>

<p>"Well, I should like to know whoever will suit you Eva,"
said Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>"Oh, he will come along, Aunty, never fear! I shall
know him when I see him, and I dare say everybody will
wonder what in the world possessed me, but <em>I</em> shall be
content. I know exactly what I want, I'm like the old party
in the Ancient Mariner. I shall know when I see him 'the
man that must have me,' and then I shall 'hold him with
my glittering eye.'"</p>

<p>"Well, Eva, you must remember one thing. There are
not many men able to keep you in the way you always have
lived."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, when the right one comes I shall live as he is able
to keep me."</p>

<p>"Go to housekeeping in three rooms, perhaps. You look
like it."</p>

<p>"Yes; and do my own cooking. I'm rather fond of
cooking; I have decided genius that way too. Ask Jane
down in the kitchen if I don't make splendid fritters. The
fact is, Aunty, I have so much superfluous activity and
energy that I should be quite thrown away on a rich man.
A poor country rector, very devout, with dark eyes like
Longfellow's Kavanah is rather my ideal. I would get up
his surplices myself, and make him such lovely frontals and
altar cloths! Why doesn't somebody of that sort come
after me? I'm quite impatient to have a sphere and show
what I can do."</p>

<p>"Well," said Alice, "you don't catch me marrying a poor
man. Not I. No home missionaries, nor poor rectors, nor
distressed artists need apply at this office."</p>

<p>"Now, girls," said Aunt Maria, "let me tell you it's all
very pretty at your turn of life to dream about love in a
cottage and all that, but when you have seen all of life that
I have, you will know the worth of the solid; when one has
been used to a certain way of living, for example, one can't
change; and if you married the angel Gabriel without
money, you would soon repent it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Eva, "I'd risk it if Gabriel would have me,
and I'd even try it with some man a little lower than the
angels; so prepare your mind to endure it, Aunty, for one
of these days everybody will be holding up their hands and
saying, What, Eva Van Arsdel engaged to <em>him!</em> Why,
what <em>could</em> have possessed her? That's just the way I
heard Lottie Simmons talking last week about Belle St.
John's engagement. She is going to marry a college professor
in New Haven on one of those very hom&oelig;opathic
doses of salary that people give to really fine men that
have talent and education, and she's just as happy as she
can be about it, and the girls are all scraping their throats,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
'oh-ing and ah-ing' and wondering what <em>could</em> have led her
to it. No engagement ring <em>to show!</em> private wedding! and
just going off together up to his mother's in Vermont
instead of making the bridal tour of all the watering places!
It must be so charming, you see, to be exhibited as a new
bride, along with all the other new brides at Trenton and
Niagara and the White Mountains, so that everybody may
have a chance to compare your finery with everybody
else's, also to see how you conduct yourself in new circumstances.
For my part I shall be very glad if my poor rector
can't afford it."</p>

<p>"By the by, speaking of that girl," said Aunt Maria,
"what are you going to wear to the wedding. It's quite
time you were attending to that. I called in at Tullegig's,
and of course she was all in a whirl, but I put in for you.
'Now, Madame,' said I, 'you must leave a place in your
mind for my girls,' and of course she went on with her
usual French rodomontade, but I assure you you'll have
to look after her. Tullegig has no conscience, and will put
you off with anything she can make you take, unless you
give your mind to it and follow her up."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure, aunty, I don't feel equal to getting a
new dress out of Tullegig," said Eva, with a sigh, "and I
have dresses enough, any one of which will do. I am <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasée</i>
with dresses, and I think weddings are a drug. If there's
anything that I think downright vulgar and disagreeable
it's this style of blaring, flaring, noisy, crowded disagreeable
modern weddings. It is a crush of finery; a smash of
china; a confusion of voices; and everybody has the headache
after it; it's a perfect infliction to think of being
obliged to go to another. For my part I believe I am going
to leave all those cares to Alice; she is come out now, and I
am only Queen Dowager."</p>

<p>"Oh pshaw, Eva, don't talk so," said Aunt Maria, "and
now I think of it you don't look well, you ought to take a
tonic in the Spring. Let me see, Calisaya Bark and iron is
just the thing. I'll send you in a bottleful from Jennings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
as I go home, and you must take a tablespoonful three times
a day after eating, and be very particular not to fatigue
yourself."</p>

<p>"I think," said Alice, "that Eva gets tired going to all
those early services."</p>

<p>"Oh my dear child, yes; how can you think of such a
thing? It's very inconsiderate in Mr. Selwyn, I think, to
have so many services when he must know many weddings
and things are coming off just after Easter. People will be
all fagged out, just as Eva is. Now I believe in the church
as much as anybody, but in our day I think there is danger
in running religion to extremes."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Eva, "I suppose there is no danger of one
running to extremes in anything but religion&mdash;in dress or
parties for instance?"</p>

<p>"But you know one has these things to attend to, my
dear; one must keep up a certain style; and of course,
there is a proper medium that I hold to as much as anybody.
Nobody is more particular about religion in its
place than I am. I keep Sunday strictly; very few people
more so. I never ride in the park Sundays, nor write a letter,
though I have seen people who called themselves religious
that would. No. I believe in giving full observance
to the Lord's day, but then I think one ought to have the
week clear for action. That belongs to us, as I view it, and
our old rector was very easy with us about all the Saint's
days, and week-day services, and things in the prayer-book.
To be sure there are Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.
One, of course, should attend to these, that is no more than
is proper, but the way Mr. Selwyn goes on! why, one
wouldn't be able to think of much else than religion if
he had his way."</p>

<p>"What a dreadful state of society that would bring on!"
said Eva.</p>

<p>"But come, Aunty," said Alice, "don't talk theology, tell
us what discoveries you made at the Elmore's. I know they
showed you everything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, of course they did. Well there's the wedding veil,
cost two thousand dollars; for my part I thought it looked
ordinary after all; it's so thick and stiff with embroidery,
you see, no lightness to it."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take it as a gift," said Eva. "I think such
expensive things are simply vulgar."</p>

<p>"Go on, Aunty," said Alice, "what next?"</p>

<p>"Well, then the dress has a new style of trimming, and
really is very elegant. I must do it the justice to say that
it's something quite <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recherché</i>. And then they took me up
stairs to see the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trousseau</i>, and there was a perfect bazar!
all her things laid out by dozens and tied up with pink
ribbons,&mdash;you would have thought it got for the Empress.
Those Elmores are the most worldly family I ever did hear
of; all for dash and show! They seemed to be perfectly
transported with these things,&mdash;and that reminds me, Eva,
I noticed last Sunday at church your new poplin suit was
made with quillings; now they are not going to wear quillings
any more. I noticed none of those Paris dresses had
it. You should have Jacobs alter yours at once, and substitute
fringes; fringes is the style now."</p>

<p>"And, Aunty, what do you suppose would happen to me
if I should wear quillings when <span class="smcap">They</span> don't?" said Eva.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, you don't want to be odd, child. There
is a certain propriety in all these things. I will speak to
Jacobs about it, and send him up here. Shall I?"</p>

<p>"Well, Aunty, anything to suit you. You may take off
quillings, or put on fringe, if you won't insist on marrying
me to anybody," said Eva; "only I do wish any one fashion
would last long enough to give one time to breathe and turn
round before it has to be altered, but the Bible says the
fashion of this world passeth quickly away, and so I suppose
one must put up with it."</p>

<p>"Eva, do you correspond with Mr. Sydney?" said Aunt
Maria, after a moment's reflection.</p>

<p>"Correspond? No, to be sure I don't. What should I
do that for?"</p>

<p>"He writes to mamma, though," said Alice, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's his own affair, if he does," said Eva. "I told him,
before he went, I never corresponded with gentlemen. I
believe that is the correct thing to say. I never mean to,
either, unless it's with one whose letters are particularly interesting
to me."</p>

<p>"How do you like that young Henderson?"</p>

<p>"What, Ida's admirer?" said Eva, coloring. "Oh, we think
him nice enough. Don't we Alice?&mdash;rather jolly, in fact."</p>

<p>"And does Ida continue gracious?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. They are the best of friends," said Eva.
"The fact is, he is quite a fine fellow; and he reads things
to Ida, and she advises him about his style, you know."</p>

<p>"He and Jim Fellows always come together," said Alice;
"and I think they are both nice&mdash;in fact, rather better than
the average. He isn't quite such a rattle-cap as Jim, but
one trusts him more."</p>

<p>"Well," said Eva, "I don't like a professed joker. A man
that never is in earnest ought to wear the cap and bells, as
the court fools used to do in old times."</p>

<p>"O, bless you, child," said Alice, "that's what Jim is for;
he always makes me laugh, and I like to laugh."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that Mr. Henderson would do nicely for
Ida," said Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," said Alice, "neither he nor Jim Fellows
are marrying men. You see they haven't anything, and of
course that they can't be thinking of such things."</p>

<p>"But," said Aunt Maria, "Ida is just the wife for a poor
man. She has a turn for economy, and doesn't care for
dress and show; and could rub and scrub along, and help
to support the family. I really think she likes work for the
sake of it. I wish to mercy she could be engaged, and get
all these dreadful queer plans and notions out of her head.
I am always so puzzled what in the world to tell people
when they ask why she doesn't visit and go into society."</p>

<p>"Why not tell the truth," said Eva, "that she prefers
to help papa in his business."</p>

<p>"Because, love, that's so odd. People can't understand it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"They can't understand," said Eva, "that a woman may
be tired of leading a lazy life, and want to use her faculties.
Well, I'm sure <em>I</em> can understand it. I'd give all the world
to feel that I was of as much real use to anybody as Ida is
to papa; and I think papa likes it too. Poor, dear old papa,
with his lovely old white head, who just toils and slaves for
us. I wish I could help him too."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I can tell you how you can help him."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Marry Wat Sydney."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Aunt, what has that to do with papa?"</p>

<p>"It would have more to do than you think," said Aunt
Maria, shaking her head, mysteriously.</p>

<p class="ph3">A DISCUSSION OF THE WOMAN QUESTION FROM ALL POINTS.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t-quote.jpg" width="73" height="60" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> bold intrusion of Miss Audacia Dangereyes into
my apartment had left a most disagreeable impression
on my mind. This was not lessened by the reception
of her paper, which came to hand in due course of
next mail; and which I found to be an exposition of all the
wildest principles of modern French communism. It consisted
of attacks directed about equally against Christianity,
marriage, the family state, and all human laws and standing
order, whatsoever. It was much the same kind of writing
with which the populace of France was indoctrinated and
leavened in the era preceding the first revolution, and
which in time bore fruit in blood. In those days, as now,
such doctrines were toyed with in literary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salons</i> and aristocratic
circles, where their novelty formed an agreeable
stimulus in the vapid common-place of fashionable life.
They were then, as now, embraced with enthusiasm by fair
illuminati, who fancied that they saw in them a dawn of
some millennial glory; and were awakened from their
dream, like Madame Roland, at the foot of the guillotine,
bowing their heads to death and crying, "O Liberty, what
things are done in thy name!"</p>

<p>The principal difference between the writers on the <cite>Emancipated
Woman</cite>, and those of the French illuminati, was that
the French prototypes were men and women of elegance,
culture, and education; whereas their American imitators,
though not wanting in a certain vigor and cleverness, were
both coarse in expression, narrow in education, and wholly
devoid of common decency in their manner of putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
things. It was a paper that a man who reverenced his
mother and sisters could scarcely read alone in his own
apartments without blushing with indignation and vexation.</p>

<p>Every holy secret of human nature, all those subjects of
which the grace and the power consists in their exquisite
delicacy and tender refinement, were here handled with
coarse fingers. Society assumed the aspect of a pack of
breeding animals, and all its laws and institutions were to
return to the mere animal basis.</p>

<p>It was particularly annoying to me that this paper, with
all its coarseness and grossness, set itself up to be the head
leader of Woman's Rights; and to give its harsh clamors as
the voice of woman. Neither was I at all satisfied with the
manner in which I had been dragooned into taking it, and
thus giving my name and money to its circulation. I had
actually been bullied into it; because, never having contemplated
the possibility of such an existence as a female
bully, I had marked out in my mind no suitable course of
conduct adequate to the treatment of one. "What <em>should</em>
I have done?" I said to myself. "What <em>is</em> a man to do
under such circumstances? Shall he engage in a personal
scuffle? Shall he himself vacate his apartment, or shall he
call in a policeman?"</p>

<p>The question assumed importance in my eyes, because it
was quite possible that, having come once, she might come
again; that the same course of conduct might be used to
enforce any kind of exaction which she should choose to
lay on me. But, most of all was I sensitive, lest by any
means some report of it might get to the Van Arsdels. My
trepidation may then be guessed, on having the subject at
once proposed to me by Mr. Van Arsdel that evening as I
was sitting with him and Ida in her study.</p>

<p>"I want to know, Mr. Henderson," he said, "if you are a
subscriber for the <cite>Emancipated Woman</cite>, the new organ of
the Woman's Rights party?"</p>

<p>"Now, papa," said Ida, "that is a little unjust! It only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
<em>professes</em> to be an organ of the party, but it is not recognized
by us."</p>

<p>"Have you seen the paper?" said Mr. Van Arsdel to me.</p>

<p>Like a true Yankee I avoided the question by asking
another.</p>

<p>"Have <em>you</em> subscribed to it, Mr. Van Arsdel?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said he laughing, "I confess I have; and a
pretty mess I have made of it. It is not a paper that any
decent man ought to have in his house. But the woman
came herself into my counting-room and, actually, she
badgered me into it; I couldn't get her out. I didn't know
what to do with her. I never had a woman go on so with me
before. I was flustered, and gave her my five dollars to get
rid of her. If she had been a man I'd have knocked her
down."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa," said Ida, "I'll tell you what you should
have done; you should have called <em>me</em>. She'd have got no
money and no subscriptions out of me, nor you either if I'd
been there."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Henderson, misery loves company; has she
been to your room?" said Mr. Van Arsdel.</p>

<p>"I confess she has," said I, "and that I have done just
what you did&mdash;yielded at once."</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson, all this sort of proceeding is thoroughly
vexatious and disagreeable," said Ida; "and all the more so
that it tends directly to injure all women who are trying to
be self-supporting and independent. It destroys that delicacy
and refinement of feeling which men, and American
men especially, cherish toward women, and will make the
paths of self-support terribly hard to those who have to
tread them. There really is not the slightest reason why a
woman should cease to be a woman because she chooses to
be independent and pursue a self-supporting career. And
claiming a right to dispense with womanly decorums and
act like a man is just as ridiculous as it would be for a man
to claim the right to wear woman's clothes. Even if we
supposed that society were so altered as to give to woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
every legal and every social right that man has; and if all
the customs of society should allow her to do the utmost
that she can for herself, in the way of self-support, still,
women will be relatively weaker than men, and there will
be the same propriety in their being treated with consideration
and delicacy and gentleness that there now is. And
the assumptions of these hoydens and bullies has a tendency
to destroy that feeling of chivalry and delicacy on the part
of men. It is especially annoying and galling to me, because
I do propose to myself a path different from that in
which young women in my position generally have walked;
and such reasoners as Aunt Maria and all the ladies of her
circle will not fail to confound Miss Audacia's proceedings
and opinions, and mine, as all belonging to the same class.
As to the opinions of the paper, it is mainly by the half
truths that are in it that it does mischief. If there were not
real evils to be corrected, and real mistakes in society, this
kind of thing would have no power. As it is, I have no
doubt that it will acquire a certain popularity and do immense
mischief. I think the elements of mischief and
confusion in our republic are gathering as fast as they did
in France before the revolution."</p>

<p>"And," said I, "after all, republics are on trial before
the world. Our experiment is not yet two hundred years
old, and we have all sorts of clouds and storms gathering&mdash;the
labor question, the foreign immigration question, the
woman question, the monopoly and corporation question,
all have grave aspects."</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Henderson," said Ida, "as to this woman
question, the moderate party to which I belong is just at
that disadvantage that people always are when there is a
party on ahead of them who hold some of their principles
and are carrying them to every ridiculous extreme. They
have to uphold a truth that is constantly being brought into
disrepute and made ridiculous by these ultra advocates.
For my part, all I can do is to go quietly on with what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
knew was right before. What is right <em>is</em> right, and remains
right no matter how much ultraists may caricature it."</p>

<p>"Yes, my daughter," said Mr. Van Arsdel, "but what
would become of our country if all the women could vote,
and people like Miss Audacia Dangyereyes should stump
the country as candidates for election?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am sure," said Ida, "we should have very disagreeble
times, and a great deal to shock us."</p>

<p>"It is not merely that," said Mr. Van Arsdel, "the influence
of such women on young men would be demoralizing."</p>

<p>"When I think of such dangers," said Ida, "I am, on the
whole, very well pleased that there is no immediate prospect
of the suffrage being granted to women until a generation
with superior education and better balanced minds and better
habits of consecutive thought shall have grown up
among us. I think the gift of the ballot will come at last as
the result of a superior culture and education. And I am
in no hurry for it before."</p>

<p>"What is all this that you are talking about?" said Eva,
who came into the room just at this moment. "Ma and
Aunt Maria are in such a state about that paper that Papa
has just brought home! They say there are most horrid
things in it, Mr. Henderson; and they say that it belongs to
the party which you, and Ida, and all your progressive people
are in."</p>

<p>"It is an excresence of the party," said I; "a diseased
growth; and neither Miss Ida nor I will accept of it as any
expression of our opinion, though it does hold some things
which we believe."</p>

<p>"Well," said Eva, "I am curious to see it, just because
they don't want I should. What can there be in it so very
bad?"</p>

<p>"You may as well keep out of it, chick," said her father,
caressing her. "And now, I'll tell you, Ida, just what I
think; you <em>good</em> women are not fit to govern the world,
because you do not know, and you oughtn't to know, the
wickedness that you have got to govern. We men have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
know all about the rogues, and the sharpers, and the pickpockets,
and the bullies; we have to grow hard and sharp,
and 'cut our eye-teeth,' as the saying is, so that at last we
come to not having much faith in anybody. The rule is,
pretty much, not to believe anybody that you meet, and to
take for granted that every man that you have dealings
with will cheat you if he can. That's bad enough, but when
it comes to feeling that every <em>woman</em> will cheat you if she
can, when women cut their eye-teeth, and get to be sharp,
and hard, and tricky, as men are, then I say, Look out for
yourself, and deliver me from having anything to do with
them."</p>

<p>"Why, really!" said Eva, "papa is getting to be quite an
orator. I never heard him talk so much before. Papa, why
don't you go on to the platform at the next Woman's Rights
Convention, and give them a good blast?"</p>

<p>"Oh I'll let them alone," said Mr. Van Arsdel; "I don't
want to be mixed up with them, and I don't want my
girls to be, either. Now, I do not object to what Ida is
doing, and going to do. I think there is real sense in that,
although Mother and Aunt Maria feel so dreadfully about
it. I like to see a woman have pluck, and set herself to be
good for something in the world. And I don't see why there
shouldn't be women doctors; it is just the thing there ought
to be. But I don't go for all this hurrah and hullaballoo,
and pitching women head-first into politics, and sending
them to legislatures, and making them candidates for Congress,
and for the Presidency, and nobody knows what else."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "why not a woman President, as well as
a woman Queen of England?"</p>

<p>"Because," said he, "look at the difference. The woman
Queen in England comes to it quietly; she is born to it, and
there is no fuss about it. But whoever is set up to be
President of the United States is just set up to have his
character torn off from his back in shreds, and to be mauled,
pummeled, and covered with dirt by every filthy paper all
over the country. And no woman that was not willing to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
draggled through every kennel, and slopped into every
dirty pail of water, like an old mop, would ever consent
to run as a candidate. Why, it's an ordeal that kills a man.
It killed Gen. Harrison, and killed old Zack. And what
sort of a brazen tramp of a woman would it be that could
stand it, and come out of it without being killed? Would
it be any kind of a woman that we should want to see at
the head of our government? I tell you, it's quite another
thing to be President of a democratic republic, from what
it is to be hereditary Queen."</p>

<p>"Good for you, papa!" said Eva, clapping her hands.
"Why how you go on! I never did hear such eloquence.
No, Ida, set your mind at rest, you shan't be run for President
of the United States. You are a great deal too good
for that."</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Van Arsdel, "there's your friend, Mrs.
Cerulean, tackled me the other night, and made a convert
of me, she said. Bless me! she's a handsome woman, and I
like to hear her talk. And if we didn't live in the world
we do, and things weren't in any respect what they are,
nothing would be nicer than to let her govern the world.
But in the great rough round of business she's nothing but
a pretty baby after all,&mdash;nothing else in the world. We let
such women convert us, because we like to have them around.
It amuses us, and don't hurt them. But you can't let your
baby play with matches and gunpowder, if it wants to ever
so much. Women are famous for setting things agoing that
they don't know anything about. And then, when the explosion
comes, they don't know what did it, and run screaming
to the men."</p>

<p>"As to Mrs. Cerulean," said Eva, "I never saw anybody
that had such a perfectly happy opinion of herself, as she
has. She always thinks that she understands everything by
intuition. I believe in my heart that she'd walk into the
engine-room of the largest steamship that ever was navigated,
and turn out the chief engineer and take his place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
if he'd let her. She'd navigate by woman's God-given
instincts, as she calls them."</p>

<p>"And so she'd keep on till she'd blown up the ship," said
Mr. Van Arsdel.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "one fact is to be admitted, that men,
having always governed the world, must by this time have
acquired a good deal of traditional knowledge of the
science of government, and of human nature, which women
can't learn by intuition in a minute."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Ida, "I never was disposed to insist
on the <em>immediate</em> granting of political rights to women. I
think that they <em>are</em> rights, and that it is very important for
the good of society that these rights should finally be respected.
But I am perfectly willing, for my part, to wait
and come to them in the way, and at the time, that will be
best for the general good. I would a great deal rather come
to them by gradual evolution than by destructive revolution.
I do not want them to be forced upon society, when
there is so little preparation among women that they will do
themselves no credit by it. All history shows that the
most natural and undeniable human rights may be granted
and maintained in a way that will just defeat themselves,
and bring discredit on all the supporters of them, just as
was the case with the principles of democratic liberty in
the first French Revolution. I do not want the political
rights of woman advocated in a manner that will create
similar disturbances, and bring a lasting scandal on what
really is the truth. I do not want women to have the
ballot till they will do themselves credit and improve
society by it. I like to have the subject proposed, and
argued, and agitated, and kept up, in hopes that a generation
of women will be educated for it. And I think it is a
great deal better and safer, where it can be done, to have
people educated <em>for</em> the ballot, than to have them educated
<em>by</em> the ballot."</p>

<p>"Well, Ida, there's more sense in you than in the most
of 'em," said Mr. Van Arsdel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Ida, "I think that an immediate rush into
politics of such women as we have now, without experience
or knowledge of political economy of affairs, would be, as
Eva says, just like women's undertaking to manage the
machinery of a large steamer by feminine instincts. I
hope never to see women in public life till we have had a
generation of women who have some practical familiarity
with the great subjects which are to be considered, about
which now the best instructed women know comparatively
nothing. The question which mainly interests me at present
is a humanitarian one. It's an absolute fact that a great
portion of womankind have their own living to get; and
they do it now, as a general rule, with many of the laws and
institutions of society against them. The reason of this is,
that all these laws and institutions have been made by
men, without any consent or concurrence of theirs. Now,
as women are different from men, and have altogether a
different class of feelings and wants and necessities, it
certainly is right and proper that they should have some
share in making the laws with which they are to be governed.
It is true that the laws have been made by fathers
and brothers and husbands; but no man, however, near,
ever comprehends fully the necessities and feelings of
women. And it seems to me that a State where all the laws
are made by men, without women, is just like a family that
is managed entirely by fathers and brothers, without any
concurrence of mothers and sisters. That's my testimony,
and my view of the matter."</p>

<p>"I don't see," said Eva, "if women are to make the
laws in relation to their own interests, or to have a voice in
making them, why they need go into politics with men in
order to do it, or why they need cease to act like women.
If the thing has got to be done, I would have a parliament
of women meet by themselves, and deliberate and have a
voice in all that concerns the State. There, that's my contribution
to the programme."</p>

<p>"That's the way the Quakers manage their affairs in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
yearly meetings," said Ida. "I remember I was visiting
Aunt Dinah once, during a yearly meeting, and learned all
about it. I remember the sisters had a voice in everything
that was done. The Quaker women have acquired in this
way a great deal of facility in the management of business,
and a great knowledge of affairs. They really seem to me
superior to the men."</p>

<p>"I can account for that," said I. "A man among the
Quakers is restricted and held in, and hasn't as much to
cultivate and develop him as ordinary men in the world;
whereas, woman, among the Quakers, has her sphere widened
and developed."</p>

<p>At this moment our conversation was interrupted by the
entrance of Jim Fellows. He seemed quite out of breath
and excited, and had no sooner passed the compliments of
the evening, than he began.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "Hal, I have just come from the Police
Court, where there's a precious row. Our friend Dacia
Dangyereyes is up for blackmailing and swindling; and
there's a terrible wash of dirty linen going on. I was just
in time to get the very earliest notes for our paper."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Mr. Van Arsdel. "I hope the creature is
caught at last."</p>

<p>"Never believe that," said Jim. "She has as many lives
as a cat. They never'll get a hold on her. She'll talk 'em
all round."</p>

<p>"Disgusting!" said Ida.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Jim, "it's part of the world as it goes. She'll
come off with flying colors, doubtless, and her cock's feathers
will be flaunting all the merrier for it."</p>

<p>"How horribly disagreeable," said Eva, "to have such
women around. It makes one ashamed of one's sex."</p>

<p>"I think," said Ida, "there is not sufficient resemblance
to a real woman in her to make much trouble on her
account. She's an amphibious animal, belonging to a transition
period of human society."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jim, "if you'll believe it, Mrs. Cerulean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and two or three of the ladies of her set are actually going
to invite Dacia to their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i>, and patronize her."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Ida, flushing crimson; "it <em>cannot</em> be!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't know Mrs. Cerulean," said Jim; "Dacia
called on her with her newspaper, and conducted herself
in a most sweet and winning manner, and cast herself at
her feet for patronage; and Mrs. Cerulean, regarding her
through those glory spectacles which she usually wears,
took her up immediately as a promising candidate for the
latter-day. Mrs. Cerulean don't see anything in Dacia's
paper that, properly interpreted, need make any trouble;
because, you see, as she says, <em>everything ought to be love</em>,
everywhere, above and below, under and over, up and down,
top and side and bottom, ought to be <em>love</em>, <span class="smcap">LOVE</span>. And
then when there's general all-overness and all-throughness,
and an entire mixed-up-ativeness, then the infinite will
come down into the finite, and the finite will overflow into
the infinite, and, in short, Miss Dacia's cock's feathers will
sail right straight up into heaven, and we shall see her cheek
by jowl with the angel Gabriel, promenading the streets of
the new Jerusalem. That's the programme. Meanwhile,
Dacia's delighted. She hadn't the remotest idea of being
an angel, or anything of the sort; but since good judges
have told her she is, she takes it all very contentedly."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Ida, "it really can't be true, Mr. Fellows;
it really is impossible that such ladies as Mrs. Cerulean's set&mdash;ladies
of family and position, ladies of real dignity and
delicacy&mdash;are going to indorse the principles of that paper;
principles which go to the immediate dissolution of civilized
society."</p>

<p>"That's just what they are doing," said Jim; "And
they are having a glorious high old time doing it too. Mrs.
Cerulean herself intends to write for the paper on the subject
of fortyfication and twentification and unification, and
everything else that ends with <i>ation</i>. And it is thought it
will improve the paper to have some nice little hymns
inserted in it, to the tune of 'I Want to be an Angel.' I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
asked Mrs. Cerulean what if my friend Dacia should rip
an oath in the midst of one of her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salons</i>&mdash;you know the
little wretch does swear like a pirate; and you ought to see
how serenely she looked over my head into the far distant
future, and answered me so tenderly, as if I had been a two
hours' chicken peeping to her. 'Oh, James,' says she, 'there
are many opinions yet to be expressed on the subject of
what is commonly called profanity. I have arrived at the
conclusion myself, that in impassioned natures, what is
called profanity, is only the state of prophetic exaltation
which naturally seeks vent in intensified language. I
shouldn't think the worse of this fine vigorous creature
if, in a moment's inspired frenzy, she should burst the tame
boundaries of ordinary language. It is true, the vulgar
might call it profane. It requires anointed eyes to see such
things truly. When we have risen to these heights where
we now stand, we behold all things purified. There is
around us a new heaven and a new earth.' And so you see,
Dacia Dangyereyes turns out a tip-top angel of the new
dispensation."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ida, rising, with heightened color, "this, of
course, ends my intercourse with Mrs. Cerulean, if it be
true."</p>

<p>"But," said Eva, "how can they bear the scandal of this
disgraceful trial? This certainly will open their eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jim, "you will see, Mrs. Cerulean will adhere all
the closer for this. It's persecution, and virtue in all ages
has been persecuted; therefore, all who are persecuted, are
virtuous. Don't you see the logical consistency? And
then, don't the Bible say, 'Blessed are ye when men persecute
you, and say all manner of evil against you?'"</p>

<p>"It don't appear to me," said Ida, "that she can so far go
against all common sense."</p>

<p>"<em>Common</em> sense!" said Jim; "Mrs. Cerulean and her clique
have long since risen above anything like common sense;
all their sense is of the most uncommon kind, and relates
to a region somewhere up in the clouds, where everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
is made to match. They live in an imaginary world, and
reason with imaginary reasons, and see people through
imaginary spectacles, and have glorious good times all the
while. All I wish is, that I could get up there and live;
for you see I get into the state of prophetic ecstasy pretty
often with this confounded hard grind below here, and then,
when I rip out a naughty word, nobody sees the beauty of
it. Mother looks glum. Sister Nell says, 'Oh, Jim!' and
looks despairing."</p>

<p>"But the fact is," said Mr. Van Arsdel, "Mrs. Cerulean
is a respectable woman, of respectable family, and this
girl is a tramp; that's what she is; and it is absolutely
impossible that Mrs. Cerulean can know what she is about."</p>

<p>"Well, I delicately suggested some such thing to Mrs.
Cerulean," said Jim; "but, bless me! the way she set me
down! Says she, 'Do you men ever inquire into the character
of people that you unite with to carry your purposes?
You join with anybody that will help you, without regard
to antecedents!"</p>

<p>"She don't speak the truth," said Mr. Van Arsdel. "We
men are very particular about the record of those we join
with to carry our purposes. You wouldn't find a board of
bankers taking a man that had a record for swindling, or a
man that edited a paper arguing against all rights of property.
Doctors won't admit a man among them who has the
record of a quack or a malpractitioner. Clergymen won't
admit a man among them who has a record of licentiousness
or infidel sentiments. And if women will admit women, in
utter disregard to their record of chastity, or their lax principles
as to the family, they act on lower principles than
any body of men."</p>

<p>"Besides," said I, "that kind of tolerance cuts the very
ground from under the whole woman movement; for the
main argument for proposing it, was to introduce into politics
that superior delicacy and purity, which women manifest
in family life. But if women are going to be less careful
about delicacy and decorum and family purity than men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
are, the quagmire of politics, foul enough now, will become
putrid."</p>

<p>"Oh, come," said Eva, "the subject does get too dreadful;
I can't bear to think of it, and I move that we have a game
of whist, and put an end to it. Come, now, do let's sit
down sociably, and have something agreeable."</p>

<p>We went out into the parlor and sat down to the whist-table,
Eva and Alice, with Jim Fellows and myself respectively
as partners, and indulged ourselves in one of those
agreeable chatty games which make the designation "whist"
quite an amusing satire&mdash;one of those games played with
that charming disregard of all rules which is so inspiring.
In the best of spirits we talked across the table to each
other, trumped our partners' queens, and did all sorts of enormities
in the excitement of the brilliant by-play of conversation
which we kept up all the while. It may be a familiar
experience to many, that one never thinks of so many things
to say, and so many fruitful topics for immediate discussion,
as when one professes to be playing whist. But then, if a
young gentleman wishes a good opportunity to reconnoiter
a certain face, no more advantageous position can be given
him than to have it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis à vis</i> at the whist-table.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Henderson," said Alice, "we are going to make
a good churchman of you."</p>

<p>"I am happy to hear it," said I. "I am ready to be made
anything good of, that you can mention."</p>

<p>"Well," said Alice, "we are going to press you and Mr.
Fellows, here, into the service of the church."</p>

<p>"Shall be perfectly enchanted!" said Jim. "If the church
only knew my energies, they would have tried to get me
long before."</p>

<p>"Then," said Eva, "you must go with us to-morrow
evening; for we are going to be up all night, about the
floral decorations of our church for Easter morning. Oh!
you have no idea what splendid things we are going to do.
We shall be at work hard, all day to-morrow, upon our
wreaths and crosses; and the things must all be put up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
late at night so as to keep them from withering. Then,
you know, we must be out again to the sunrise service."</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "it is a regular piece of dissipation."</p>

<p>"Certainly,&mdash;religious dissipation, you know," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Well," said Eva, "I don't know why we should not be up
all night to dress the church, for once in our lives, as well
as to be up all night dancing the German. Ida says it is
wicked to do either. Ida makes a perfect hobby of everybody's
keeping their health."</p>

<p>"Yes, but," said I, "if people keep themselves, generally,
in temperance and soberness, they can afford a great strain,
now and then, if it be for a good purpose."</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Eva, "you and Mr. Fellows come
round and take tea with us and help us carry our trophies
to the church."</p>

<p class="ph3">COUSIN CAROLINE AGAIN.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">About</span> this time I received the following letter
from my Cousin Caroline:</p>

<p>"<i>Dear Cousin</i>:&mdash;I have had no time to keep up
correspondence with anybody for the past year. The state
of my father's health has required my constant attention,
day and night, to a degree that has absorbed all my power,
and left no time for writing. For the last six months father
has been perfectly helpless with the most distressing form
of chronic rheumatism. His sufferings have been protracted
and intense, so that it has been wearing even to witness
them; and the utmost that I could do seemed to bring very
little relief. And when, at last, death closed the scene, it
seemed to be in mercy, putting an end to sufferings which
were intolerable.</p>

<p>"For a month after his death, I was in a state of utter
prostration, both physical and mental,&mdash;worn out with
watching and care. My poor father; he was himself to
the last, reticent, silent, undemonstrative and uncommunicative.
It seemed to me that I would have given worlds
for one tender word from him. I felt a pity and a love
that I dared not show; his sufferings went to my very
heart; but he repelled every word of sympathy, and was
cold and silent to the last. Yet I believe that he really
loved me and that far within this frozen circle of ice, his
soul was a lonely prisoner, longing to express itself, and
unable; longing for the light and warmth of that love
which never could touch him in its icy depths; and I am
quite sure, it is my comfort to know, that death has broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the ice and melted the bands; and I believe that he has
entered the kingdom of heaven as a little child.</p>

<p>"The hard skies of our New England, its rocky soil, its
severe necessities, make characters like his; and they
intrench themselves in a similar religious faith which makes
them still harder. They live to aspire and to suffer, but
never to express themselves; and every soft and warm
heart that is connected with them pines and suffers and dies
like flowers that are thrown upon icebergs.</p>

<p>"Well, all is now over, and I am free of the world. I
have, in the division of the property, a few acres of wood-lot,
and many acres of rough, stony land, and about a hundred
dollars of yearly income. I must do something, therefore,
for my own support. Ever since you left us I have
been reading and studying under the care of your uncle,
who, since your conversation with him, has been very kind
and thoughtful. But then, of course, my studies have been
interrupted by some duties, and, during the last year, suspended
altogether by the necessity of giving myself to
the care of father.</p>

<p>"Now, my desire is, if I could in any way earn the means,
to go to France and perfect myself in medical studies. I
am told that a medical education can be obtained there by
women cheaper than anywhere else; and I have cast about
in my own mind how I might earn money enough to
enable me to do it. Now I ask you, who are in New
York and on the press, who know me thoroughly, and
it also, could I, should I come to New York, gain any
situation as writer for the press, which would give me
an income for a year or two, by which I could make enough
to accomplish my purpose? I should not wish to be always
a writer; it would be too exhausting; but if I could get
into a profession that I am well adapted for, I should expect
to succeed in it.</p>

<p>"I have the ability to live and make a respectable appearance
upon a very little. I know enough, practically, of
the arts of woman-craft to clothe myself handsomely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
for a small sum, and I am willing to live in cheap
obscure lodgings, and think I could board myself, also, for a
very moderate sum. I am willing to undergo privations,
and to encounter hard work to carry my purpose, and I
write to you, dear cousin, because I know you will speak
to me just as freely as though I were not a woman, and
give me your unbiased opinion as to whether or no I could
do anything in the line that I indicate. I know that you
would give me all the assistance in your power, and feel
a perfect reliance upon your friendship."</p>

<p>The letter here digressed into local details and family
incidents not necessary to be reproduced. I resolved to lay
it before Bolton. It seemed to me that his reception of it
would furnish some sort of clew to the mystery of his
former acquaintance with her. The entire silence that he
had always maintained with regard to his former knowledge
of her, while yet he secretly treasured her picture,
seemed to me to indicate that he might somehow have been
connected with that passage of her life referred to by my
mother when she said that Caroline's father had, at one
period of her life, crushed out an interest that was vital to
her.</p>

<p>"The sly old fox," said I to myself, "always draws me
on to tell him everything, while he keeps a close mouth,
and I learn nothing of him." Of course, I felt that to ask
any questions or seek to pry into a past which he evidently
was not disposed to talk about, would be an indelicate impertinence.
But my conscience and sense of honor were quite
appeased by this opportunity presented by Caroline's letter.
Bolton was older in the press than I, and, with all his
reticence and modesty, had a wide circle of influence. He
seemed contented to seek nothing for himself; but I had
had occasion to notice in my own experience that he was
not boasting idly when he said, on our first acquaintance,
that he had some influence in literary quarters. He had
already procured for me, from an influential magazine,
propositions for articles which were both flattering to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
my pride and lucrative in the remuneration. In this way,
the prospect of my yearly income, which on the part of
the <cite>Great Democracy</cite> was so very inadequate, was enlarged
to a very respectable figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">
<a name="ASYLUM" id="ASYLUM" />
<img src="images/i274.jpg" width="414" height="600" alt="BOLTON'S ASYLUM" title="BOLTON'S ASYLUM" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">BOLTON'S ASYLUM.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Bolton!" said I. "Have you got a foundling hospital here?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>I resolved, therefore, to go up to Bolton's room and put
this letter into his hands. I knocked at the door, but no one
answering I opened it and went in. He was not there, but
an odd enough scene presented itself to me. The little
tow-headed, freckled boy, that I had formerly remarked as
an inmate of the apartment, was seated by the fire with a
girl, somewhat younger than himself, nursing between
them a large fat bundle of a baby.</p>

<p>"Hallo," said I, "what have we here? What are you
doing here?" At this moment&mdash;before the children could
answer&mdash;I heard Bolton coming up the stairs. He entered
the room; a bright color mounted to his cheeks as he saw
the group by the fire, and me.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Hal!" he said, with a sort of conscious laugh.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Bolton!" said I. "Have you got a foundling
hospital here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, well," said he; "never mind; let 'em stay
there. Do you want anything? There," said he, pulling
a package of buns out of his pocket, "eat those; and when
the baby gets asleep you can lay her on the bed in the
other room. And there,"&mdash;to the boy,&mdash;"you read this story
aloud to your sister when the baby is asleep. And now,
Hal, what can I do for you? Suppose I come down into
your room for awhile and talk?"</p>

<p>He took my arm, and we went down the stairs together;
and when we got into my room he shut the door and said:</p>

<p>"The fact is Hal, I have to take care of that family&mdash;my
washerwoman, you know. Poor Mrs. Molloy, she has a
husband that about once a month makes a perfect devil
of himself, so that the children are obliged to run and hide
for fear of their lives. And then she has got the way of
sending them to me, and I have to go down and attend to
him."</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></p>

<p>"Bless me!" said I, "why will women live with such
brutes? Why don't you make her separate from him?"</p>

<p>Bolton seated himself at my table, and leaned back in
his chair, with a curious expression of countenance, very
sad, yet not without a touch of humor in it.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," he said, "the fact is, Hal, she loves him."</p>

<p>"Well, she oughtn't to love him," said I.</p>

<p>"May be not; but she does," said he. "She loves that
poor Pat Molloy so much that to be angry with him is
just like your right hand being angry with your left hand.
Suppose there's a great boil on the left hand, what's the
right to do about it but simply bear the suffering and wait
for it to get well? That, you see, is love; and because
of it, you can't get women away from their husbands. What
are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"But," said I, "it is perfectly absurd for a woman to
cling to such a man."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bolton, "three weeks of the month Pat
Molloy is just as kind and tender a father and husband
as you will find, and then by the fourth week comes around
his drunken spell, and he's a devil. Now she says, 'Sure
sir, it's the drink. It's not Pat at all sir; he's not himself
sir.' And she waits till it's over&mdash;taking care that he
doesn't kill the children. Now, shall I persuade her to let
him go to the devil? Does not Jesus Christ say, 'Gather
up the fragments that nothing be lost'? He said it about
a basket of bread; wouldn't he say it still more about
the fragments of the human soul? If she leaves Pat,
where will he go to? First, to some harlot, then to murder,
and the gallows&mdash;and that gets him out of the way."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "isn't he better out than in?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?" said Bolton. "All I have to say is, that
poor Molly Molloy, with her broad Irish brogue, and her
love that can't be tired, and can't give him up, and that
bears, and believes, and hopes, and endures, seems to me
a revelation of the Christ-like spirit a thousand times more
than if she was tramping to a woman's rights convention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and exposing her wrongs and calling down justice on his
head."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "look at the children! Oughtn't she to
part with him on their account?"</p>

<p>"Yes, look at the children," said he. "The little things
have learned already, from their mother, to care for each
other, and to care for their father. In their little childish
way, they love and bear with him just as she does. The
boy came to me this afternoon and said, 'Father's got another
crazy spell.' Already he has a delicacy in his very
mode of speaking; and he doesn't say his father is <em>drunk</em>,
but that he is <em>crazy</em>, as he is. And then he and the little
girl are so fatherly and motherly with the baby. Now, I
say, all this growth of virtue around sin and sorrow is
something to be revered. The fact is"&mdash;he added&mdash;</p>

<p>"The day for separating the tares from the wheat
hasn't come yet. And it seems to me that the moral discipline
of bearing with evil, patiently, is a great deal better
and more ennobling than the most vigorous assertion of
one's personal rights. I can see a great deal of suffering in
that family from poor Pat's weakness and wickedness, but I
also see most noble virtues growing up, even in these children,
from the straits to which they are put. And as to
poor Pat himself, he comes out of his demon-baptism penitent
and humble, and more anxious to please than ever. It
is really affecting to see with what zeal he serves me, when
I have brought him through a 'drunk.' And yet I know
that it will have to be gone over, and over, and over again.
Sometimes it seems to me he is like the earth after a thunder-shower&mdash;fresher
and clearer than he was before. And
I am quite of Mrs. Molloy's mind&mdash;there is too much good
in Pat to have him swept off into the gutter for the bad;
and so, as God gives her grace to suffer, let her suffer.
And if I can bear one little end of her cross, I will. If
she does not save him in this life, she'll save him from
sinking lower in demonism. She may only keep his head
above water till he gets past the gates of death, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
perhaps, in the next life, he will appear to be saved by
just that much which she has done in keeping him up."</p>

<p>Bolton spoke with an intense earnestness, and a sad and
solemn tone, as if he were shaken and almost convulsed by
some deep, internal feeling. For some moments there was
a silence between us,&mdash;the silence of a great unuttered emotion.
At last, he drew a long breath, and said, "Well, Hal,
what was it you wanted to talk about?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said I, "I have a letter from a friend of mine that
I wanted to show you, to see whether you could do anything"&mdash;and
I gave him Caroline's letter.</p>

<p>He sat down under the gas-light to read it. The sight of
the hand-writing seemed to affect him at once. His large,
dark eyes flashed over the letter, and he turned it quickly,
and looked at the signature; a most unutterable expression
passed over his face, like that of a man who is in danger
of giving away to some violent emotion; and then, apparently
by a great effort of self-constraint, he set himself
carefully to reading the letter. He read it over two or three
times, folded it up, and handed it back to me without any
remark, and then sat leaning forward on the table with his
face shaded with his hand.</p>

<p>"My cousin is a most uncommon character," I said; "and,
as you will observe by this letter, has a good deal of ability
as a writer."</p>

<p>"I am acquainted with her," he said, briefly, making a
sudden movement with his hand.</p>

<p>"Indeed? Where did you know her?"</p>

<p>"Years ago," he said, briefly. "I taught the academy
in her village, and she was one of my scholars. I know
the character of her mind."</p>

<p>There was a dry brevity in all this, of a man who is
afraid that he shall express more than he means to.</p>

<p>Said I, "I showed this letter to you because I thought
you had more influence in the press than I have; and if you
are acquainted with her, so much the better, as you can
judge whether she can gain any employment here which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
would make it worth her while to come and try. I have
always had an impression that she had very fine mental
powers."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt about that," he said, hurriedly. "She
is an exceptional woman."</p>

<p>He rose up, and took the letter from me. "If you will
allow me to retain this a while," he said, "I will see what
I can do; but just now I have some writing to finish. I
will speak to you about it to-morrow."</p>

<p>That evening, I introduced the subject to my friend,
Ida Van Arsdel, and gave her a sketch of Caroline's life-history.
She entered into it with the warmest interest,
and was enthusiastic in her desire that the plan might succeed.</p>

<p>"I hope that she will come to New York," she said, "so
that we can make her acquaintance. Don't, pray, fail to let
me know, Mr. Henderson, if she should be here, that I may
call on her."</p>

<p class="ph3">EASTER LILIES.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> next afternoon Jim and I kept our appointment
with the Van Arsdel's. We found one of the parlors
transformed to a perfect bower of floral decorations.
Stars and wreaths and crosses and crowns were
either just finished or in process of rapid construction under
fairy fingers. When I came in, Eva and Alice were busy on
a gigantic cross, to be made entirely of lilies of the valley,
of which some bushels were lying around on the carpet.
Ida had joined the service, and was kneeling on the floor
tying up the flowers in bunches to offer them to Eva.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Henderson, the difference between modern
religion and the primitive Christians," she said. "Their
cross was rough wood and hard nails; ours is lilies and
roses made up in fashionable drawing-rooms."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," said Eva, "our <em>crown</em> may prove much of
the same material!"</p>

<p>"I sometimes wonder," said Ida, "whether all the money
spent for flowers at Easter could not better be spent in
some mode of relieving the poor."</p>

<p>"Well," said Eva, "I am sorry to bring up such a parallel,
but isn't that just the same kind of remark that Judas made
about the alabaster vase of ointment?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "what could be more apparently useless
than a mere perfume, losing itself in the air, and vanishing
entirely? And yet the Saviour justified that lavish expenditure
when it was the expression of a heart-feeling."</p>

<p>"But," said Ida, "don't you think it very difficult to
mark the line where these services and offerings to religious
worship become excessive?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course it is," said I; "but no more difficult on this
subject than any other."</p>

<p>"That's the great trouble in this life," said Eva. "The
line between right and wrong seems always so indefinite,
like the line between any two colors of the prism&mdash;it is
hard to say just where one ends and another begins."</p>

<p>"It is the office of common sense," I said, "to get the
exact right in all such matters&mdash;there is a sort of <em>instinct</em>
in it."</p>

<p>"Well, all I have to say about it is," said Eva, "since
we do spend lavishly and without stint in our houses and
in our dress for adornment, we ought to do at least as
much for our religion. I like to see the adornment of a
church generous, overflowing, as if we gave our very best.
As to these lilies, I ordered them of an honest gardener, and
it goes to help support a family that would be poor if it were
not for these flowers. It is better to support one or two
families honestly, by buying their flowers for churches
than it is to give the money away. So I look on it."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Alice, "there is no end to anything.
Everything you do tends to something else; and everything
leads to something; and there is never any knowing about
anything; and so I think it is best just to have as good a
time as you can, and do everything that is agreeable, and
make everything just as pretty as it can be. And I think it
is fun to trim up the church for Easter. There now! And
it don't do any harm. And I just like to go to the sunrise
service, if it does make one sleepy all day. What do you
say, Mr. Fellows? Do you think you could go through
with the whole of it?"</p>

<p>"Miss Alice, if you only go you will find me inspired
with the spirit of a primitive Christian in this respect,"
said Jim. "I shall follow wherever you lead the way, if it's
ever so late at night, or ever so early in the morning."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Henderson," said she, "may we depend on you,
too?"</p>

<p>"By all means," said I, as I sat industriously gathering up
the lilies into bunches and tying them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson is in a hopeful way," said Eva. "I think
we may have him in the true church some of these times."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said Ida, "that Mr. Henderson, having
seen you only in Lent, won't be able to keep track of you
when the Easter rejoicings begin, and the parties recommence."</p>

<p>"Oh dear me!" said Eva, with a sort of shudder, "To
think of that horrid wedding!"</p>

<p>"That's just like Eva," said Alice. "She's been, and been,
and been to these things till she's tired out with them;
whereas, I am just come out, and I like them, and want
more of them. I don't think they are horrid at all. I am
perfectly delighted about that Elmore wedding. One will
see there all the new things, and all the stunning things,
and all the latest devices from Paris. I was in at Tullegig's
the other day, and you never saw such a sight as her rooms
are! Somebody said it looked as if rainbows had been
broken to pieces and thrown all round. She showed me all
the different costumes that she was making up for the various
parties. You know there are to be seven bride's-maids,
and each of them is to wear a different color. Madame
thinks '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est si gentil</i>.' Then, you know, they are
making such grand preparations up at that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chateau</i> of
theirs. The whole garden is to be roofed in and made a
ball room of. I think it will be gorgeous. I say, Mr. Fellows,
if you and Mr. Henderson would like it, I know I
could manage cards for you."</p>

<p>Jim assented, heartily, for both of us; and I added that
I should like to see the affair; for I had never seen enough
of that sort of thing to take away the novelty.</p>

<p>After tea we all sallied out to the church with our
trophies. We went in two carriages, for the better accommodation
of these, and had a busy time disembarking at
the church and carrying them in. Here we met a large
committee of co-workers, and the scene of real business
commenced. Jim and I worked heroically under the direction
of our fair superintendents. By midnight the church
was a bower of fragrance and beauty. The chancel seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
a perfect bed of lilies, out of which rose the great white
cross, shedding perfume upon the air. The baptismal font
was covered with a closely woven mosaic of fragrant violets,
and in each panel appeared an alternate red or white
cross formed of flowers. The font was filled with a tall
bouquet of white saint's-lilies, such as gardeners force for
Easter.</p>

<p>Eva and I worked side by side this evening, and never
had I seemed to know her more intimately. The fact is,
among other dangerous situations to a young man's heart,
none may be mentioned more seductive than to be in a
church twining flowers and sorting crosses and emblems in
the still holy hours of the night. One's head gets, somehow,
bewildered; all worldly boundaries of cold prudence
fade away; and one seems to be lifted up to some other
kind of land where those that are congenial never part
from each other. So I felt when, our work being all done,
I retired with Eva to the shadow of a distant pew to survey
the whole result. We had turned on the gas-light to
show our work, and its beams, falling on thousands of
these white lily-bells and on all the sacred emblems, shed
a sort of chastened light. Again, somehow, as if it had
been a rose-leaf floating down from heaven, I found that
little hand in mine; and we spoke low to each other, in
whispers, of how good and how pleasant it was to be there,
and to unite in such service and work&mdash;words that meant
far more than they seemed to say. Once, in the course of
the evening, I saw her little glove where it had fallen into
a nest of cast-off flowers, and, as no one was looking, I
seized upon it as a relic, and appropriated it to my own
sacred memories. Nor would I surrender it, though afterward
I heard her making pathetic inquiries for it. Late
at night I went home to think and dream, and woke with
the first dim gray of morning, thinking of my appointment
to meet her at the church.</p>

<p>It is a charming thing to go out in the fresh calm morning
before any one is stirring. The bells for early service
were dropping their notes here and there, down through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
air, as if angels were calling men to awake and remember
that great event which happened so silently and so unregarded,
many, many years ago. I thought as I walked
through the dim streets and saw here and there an early
worshiper, prayer-book in hand, stealing along, of the
lonely women who, years ago, in Jerusalem, sought the
sepulchre to see where they had laid Him.</p>

<p>Little twittering sparrows filled the ivy on the outside of
the church and made it vibrate with their chirpings. There
was the promise in the brightening skies of a glorious sunrise.
I stood waiting awhile, quite alone, till one by one
the bands of youths and maidens came from different directions.</p>

<p>I had called Jim as I went out, but he, preferring to take
the utmost latitude for sleep, looked at his watch and told
me he would take another half hour before he joined us.</p>

<p>Eva was there, however, among the very first. The girls,
she said, were coming. We went into the dim church together
and sat ourselves down in the shady solitude of one
of the slips waiting for the morning light to pour through
the painted windows. We said nothing to each other; but
the silence was sociable and not blank. There are times
in life when silence between two friends is better than
speech; for they know each other by intuition.</p>

<p>Gradually the church filled with worshipers; and as the
rising sun streamed through the painted windows and
touched all the lilies with brightness, a choir of children in
the organ-loft broke forth into carols like so many invisible
birds. And then, the old chant,</p>

<p>
"Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more,"<br />
</p>

<p>seemed to thrill every heart.</p>

<p>After the service came a general shaking of hands and
greetings from neighbors and friends, as everybody walked
round examining the decorations.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Henderson," said Eva, as she stood with me
surveying this scene, "is not a church which preserves all
these historical memorials a most lovely one? Ought we
not thus to cherish the memory of that greatest event that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
ever happened in this world? And how beautiful it is to
bring up children year after year by festivals like these, to
mark off their life in acts of remembrance."</p>

<p>"You speak truly," I said, sharing her enthusiasm. "I
could wish the church of all good people had never ceased to
keep Easter; indeed, they who do disregard it seem to me
a cold minority out of the great fellowship. I think it is
fortunate that the Romish and the Episcopal churches are
bringing us, descendants of the Puritans, back to those
primitive customs. I, for one, come back willingly and
joyfully."</p>


<p class="centermt2">[Eva Van Arsdel to Isabel Convers.]</p>

<p><i>My Darling Belle</i>:&mdash;I have been a naughty girl to let your
letter lie so long. But my darling, it is not true, as you
there suggest, that the bonds of sisterly affection, which
bound us in school, are growing weaker, and that I no
longer trust you as a confidential friend. Believe me, the
day will never come, dearest Belle, when I shall cease to
unfold to you every innermost feeling.</p>

<p>And now to come to the point about "that Mr. Henderson."
Indeed, my love, your cautions are greatly mistaken.
It is true that, much to my surprise, he has taken a fancy
to visit quite intimately at our house, and has made himself
a general favorite in the family. Mamma, and Aunt
Maria, and all the girls like him so much. But, then, you
must know he is generally set down as Ida's admirer. At
all events Ida and he are extremely good friends; and when
he calls here he generally spends the largest part of the
evening in her sanctum; and they have most edifying conversations
on all the approved modern topics&mdash;the Darwinian
theory, woman's rights, and everything else you can
think of. One thing I admit is a little peculiar&mdash;he notices
everything that <em>I</em> say in conversation&mdash;I must own. I never
saw such an observing creature. For example, the first
evening he was at our house, I just accidentally dropped
before him the remark that I was going to early morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
services in Lent, and would you believe it?&mdash;the next morning
he was there too, and walked home with me. I was
the more astonished, because he does not belong to the
Church&mdash;so one would not expect it, you know. He is a
member of the Bethany Church himself, but he seems delighted
with our services, and talks about them beautifully&mdash;as
well as our rector could. I really wish you could
have heard him! He seems to have such an earnest,
thoughtful mind; and what I like in him is, that he never
flatters, and talks that matter-of-course complimentary
nonsense, that some men think is the thing to be talked
to ladies; neither has he that way of <em>talking down</em> to one
that superior men sometimes have, when they are talking
with us girls. I read somewhere this sentiment&mdash;that
we may know the opinion people have of us by the kind
of conversation they address to us&mdash;and if this is so I
ought to be flattered by the way Mr. Henderson talks to
me; for I think he shows quite as much anxiety to find
out my opinion on all subjects as he does Ida's. You
will, perhaps, think it rather peculiar if I tell you that
ever since that first morning he has been as constant at
the morning services as I have, and always walks home
with me. In this way we really are getting quite intimately
acquainted. Now, Belle, don't put on that knowing
look of yours, and intimate that there is anything
<em>particular</em> in all this, for there is <em>not</em>. I do assure you there
is not a bit of nonsense in it. You would be perfectly
astonished to hear how gravely and philosophically we talk.
We moralize and philosophize, and as Jim Fellows would
say, "come the high moral dodge" in a way that would
astonish you.</p>

<p>And yet, Belle, they wrong us who are called fashionable
girls, when they take for granted that we are not capable of
thinking seriously, and that we prefer those whose conversation
consists only of flattery and nonsense. It is mainly
because I feel that Mr. Henderson has deep, serious purposes
in life, and because he appreciates and addresses himself
to the deepest part of my nature that his friendship is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
valuable to me. I say <em>friendship</em> advisedly, dear Belle,
because I insist upon it that there <em>can</em> be friendship, pure
and simple, between a gentleman and a lady; in our case
there is "only this and nothing more."</p>

<p>How very teasing and provoking it is that there cannot be
this friendship without observation and comment! Now I
am very careful to avoid any outward appearance of special
intimacy that might make talk, and he appears to be very
careful also. After the first day at morning service he did
not join me immediately on going out of church, but went
out at another door and joined me at the next corner. I
was so thankful for it, for old Mrs. Eyelett was there with
her sharp eyes, and I know by experience that though she
is a pillar of the church she finds abundance of leisure from
her devotions to watch all the lambs of the flock; and I am
one that everybody seems to keep specially in mind as
proper to be looked after. If I only speak to, or look at,
or walk with the same person more than once, the airy
tongues of rumor are busy engaging and marrying me.
Isn't it horrid? I would not have old Mrs. Eyelett get
anything of this sort into her head for the world; it's so
disagreeable to have such a thing get to a gentleman's
hearing when he knows there is no truth in it; and the
world has condescended to interest itself so much in my
fortunes that it seems dangerous for anybody to be more
than civil without being set down as an aspirant.</p>

<p>The only comfort there is in being persistently reported
engaged to Mr. Sydney is that it serves to keep off other
reports, and I sometimes think of the old fable of the fox
who would not have the present swarm of flies driven off
lest there should come a new one in its place. How I wish
people would let one's private affairs alone! Here I must
break off, for there is company down stairs.</p>


<p class="right">
<i>Wednesday Eve</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I have let this thing lie some days, dear Belle, because
there has been so much going and coming, time has flitted
away. Mr. H. has been at our house a good deal. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
made a discovery about him. He has a beautiful cousin that
he thinks everything of&mdash;"Cousin Caroline"&mdash;and she is a
very superior woman. So you see how silly all your suggestions
are, Belle. For aught I know he may be engaged
to this cousin Caroline. I believe she is coming to New
York, and I am just wild to see her. You know I want
to see if I shall like her. She must be just the thing
for him; and I <em>hope</em> I shall like her. Ida thinks she shall.
Aunt Maria, who wants to portion off the fate of mortals,
has made up her mind that Mr. H. <em>must</em> be an admirer of
Ida's; and in short, that they are to be for each other.</p>

<p>Ida looks down on all this sort of thing with her placid
superiority. She has a perfect contempt for it, so <em>very</em> perfect
that it is quiet. She does not even trouble herself to
express it. Ida <em>likes</em> Mr. H. very much, and has a straightforward,
open, honest friendship with him, and doesn't
trouble her head a bit what people may say.</p>


<p class="right">
<i>Saturday Morning</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>We are all busy now about Easter decorations. We have
ordered no end of flowers, and are going into adornments on
a great scale. We press all hands in that we can get. Mr.
Henderson and Jim Fellows are coming to-night to tea to
help us carry our things to church and get them up.</p>


<p class="right">
<i>Monday Morning</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I am so tired. We were up nearly all night Saturday, and
then at the sunrise service Easter morning, and services
all day. Beautiful! Lovely as they could be! But if one
has a good time in this world, one must pay for it&mdash;and I am
all tired out.</p>

<p>Mr. Henderson was with us through the whole affair.
One thing seemed to me quite strange. I dropped my glove
among some flowers, while I was busy putting up a wreath
of lilies, and I saw him through a bower of hemlock trees
walk up to the spot, and slyly confiscate the article. In a
moment I came back, and said, "I dropped my glove here.
Where can it be?" The wretched creature helped me search
for it, with every appearance of interest, but never offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
to restore the stolen goods. It was all so quiet&mdash;so private!
You know, gentlemen often pretend, as a matter of gallantry,
that they want your glove, or a ribbon, or some
such memento; but this was all so secret. He evidently
thinks I don't know it; and, Belle&mdash;what should <em>you</em> think
about it?</p>

<p class="ph3">ENCHANTMENT AND DISENCHANTMENT.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_d.jpg" width="60" height="61" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">During</span> a month after Easter, I was, so to speak, in
a state of mental somnambulism, seeing the visible
things of this mortal life through an enchanted
medium, in which old, prosaic, bustling New York, with
its dry drudgeries and uninteresting details, became suddenly
vivified and glorified; just as when some rosy sunset
floods with light the matter-of-fact architecture of Printing-House
Square, and etherealizes every line, and guides
every detail, and heightens every bit of color, till it all
seems picturesque and beautiful.</p>

<p>I did not know what was the matter with me, but I felt
somehow as if I had taken the elixir of life and was breathing
the air of an immortal youth. Whenever I sat down
to write I found my inspiration. I no longer felt myself
alone in my thoughts and speculations; I wrote <em>to</em> another
mind, a mind that I felt would recognize mine; and then
I carried what I had written, and read it to Ida Van Arsdel
for her criticisms. Ida was a capital critic, and had graciously
expressed her willingness and desire to aid me
in this way, to any extent. But was it Ida who was my
inspiration?</p>

<p>Sitting by, bent over her embroidery, or coming in accidentally
and sitting down to listen, was Eva; full of
thought, full of inquiry; sometimes gay and airy, sometimes
captious and controversial&mdash;always suggestive and
inspiring. From these readings grew talks protracted and
confidential, on all manner of subjects; and each talk was
the happy parent of more talks, till it seemed that there was
growing up an endless series of occasions for our having
long and exciting interviews; for, what was said yesterday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
in the reflections and fancies of the night following, immediately
blossomed out into queries and consequences and
inferences on both sides, which it was immediately and
pressingly necessary that we should meet to compare and
adjust. Now, when two people are in this state of mind,
it is surprising what a number of providential incidents are
always bringing them together. It was perfectly astonishing
to us both to find how many purely accidental interviews
we had. If I went out for a walk, I was sure, first
or last, to meet her. To be sure I took to walking very
much in streets and squares where I had observed she
might be expected to appear&mdash;but that did not make the
matter seem to me the less unpremeditated.</p>

<p>I had been in the habit of taking a daily constitutional
stroll in Central Park, and the Van Arsdels were in the
habit of driving there, at orthodox fashionable hours. In
time, it seemed to happen that this afternoon stroll of mine
always brought forth the happy fruit of a pleasant interview.</p>

<p>There was no labyrinth or bower or summer-house, no
dingle or bosky dell, so retired that I did not find it occasionally
haunted by the presence of this dryad.</p>

<p>True she was not there alone; sometimes with Ida, sometimes
with Alice, or with a lively bevy of friends&mdash;but it
made no difference with whom, so long as she was there.</p>

<p>The many sins of omission and commission of which the
City Fathers of New York are accused, are, I think, wonderfully
redeemed and covered by the beauties of the provision
for humanity which they have made in Central Park.
Having seen every park in the world, I am not ashamed
to glorify our own, as providing as much beauty and cheap
pleasure as can anywhere be found under the sun.</p>

<p>Especially ought all lovers <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i> to crown the
projectors and executors of this Park with unfading wreaths
of olive and myrtle. It is so evidently adapted to all the
purposes of falling in love and keeping in love that the only
wonder is that any one can remain a bachelor in presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of such advantages and privileges! There is all the peacefulness,
all the seclusion, all the innocent wildness of a
country Arcadia, given for the price of a five cents' ride in
the cars to any citizen who chooses to be made moral and
innocent.</p>

<p>The Central Park is an immortal poem, forever addressing
itself to the eye and ear in the whirl and bubble of that
hot and bewildered city. It is a Wordsworth immortalized
and made permanent, preaching to the citizens.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent1">"One impulse from a vernal mood</div>
	  <div class="verse indent2">May teach you more of man&mdash;</div>
	  <div class="verse">Of moral evil, and of good&mdash;</div>
	  <div class="verse indent2">Than all the sages can."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Certainly during this one season of my life I did full justice
to the beauties of Central Park. There was not a nook
or corner where wild flowers unfolded, where white-stemmed
birches leaned over still waters, or ivies clambered over
grottoed rocks, which I did not explore; and when in the
winding walks of "the Ramble" I caught distant sight of a
white drapery, or heard through budding thickets the silvery
sounds of laughing and talking, I knew I was coming
on one of those pleasant surprises for which the Park
grounds are so nicely arranged.</p>

<p>Sometimes Eva would come with a carriage full of children,
and with the gay little fairies would pass a sunny
afternoon, swinging them, watching them riding in the
little goat-carriages, or otherwise presiding over their gaieties.
We had, under these circumstances, all the advantage
of a tête-à-tête without any of the responsibility of seeking
or prolonging it. In fact, the presence of others was a
salvo to my conscience, and to public appearance, for, looking
on Eva as engaged to another, I was very careful not to
go over a certain line of appearances in my relations to her.
My reason told me that I was upon dangerous ground for
my own peace, but I quieted reason as young men in my
circumstances generally do, by the best of arguments.</p>

<p>I said to myself that, "No matter if she were engaged,
why shouldn't I worship at her shrine, and cherish her unage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
as Dante did that of Beatrice, and Tasso that of
Eleanora d'Este?" and so on.</p>

<p>"To be sure," I reflected, "this thing can never come to
anything; of course she never can be anything to you more
than a star in the heavens. But," I said in reply, "she is
mine to worship and adore with the worship that we give
to all beautiful things. She is mine as are fair flowers,
and the blue skies, and the bright sunshine, which cheer
and inspire."</p>

<p>I was conscious that I had in my own most sacred receptacle
at home, a little fairy glove that she had dropped, to
which I had no claim; but I said to myself, "When a leaf
falls from the rose, who shall say that I shall not gather it
up?" So, too, I had one of those wonderful, useless little
bits of fairy gossamer, which Eve's daughters call a <em>pocket-handkerchief</em>.
I had yet so little sense of sin that I stole
that too, kept the precious theft folded in my prayer-book,
and thought <em>she</em> would never know it. I began to understand
the efficacy that is ascribed to holy relics, for it
seemed to me that if ever any deadly trouble or trial
should come upon me, I would lay these little things upon
my heart, and they would comfort me.</p>

<p>And yet, all this while, I solemnly told myself I was
<em>not in love</em>,&mdash;oh, no, not in the least. This was <em>friendship</em>&mdash;the
very condensed, distilled essence of friendship, that
and nothing more. To be sure it was friendship set to a
heroic key&mdash;friendship of a rare quality. I longed to do
something for her, and often thought how glad I would be
to give my life for her. Having a very active imagination,
sometimes as I lay awake at night I perpetrated all sorts
of confusions in the city of New York, for the sole purpose
of giving myself an opportunity to do something for
her. I set fire to the Van Arsdel mansion several times, in
different ways, and, rushing in, bore her through the flames.
I inaugurated a horrible plot against the life of her father,
and rushing in at the critical moment, delivered the old
gentleman that I might revel in her delight. I became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
suddenly a millionaire by the death of a supposititious uncle
in the East Indies, and immediately proceeded to lay all my
treasures at her feet.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Wat Sydney, it is incredible the resignation
with which I saw him ship-wrecked, upset in stages, crushed
in railroad accidents, while I appeared on the scene as the
consoling friend; not that I had, of course, any purpose of
causing such catastrophes, but there was a degree of resignation
attending the view of them that was soothing.</p>

<p>I had in my heart a perfect certainty that Sydney was
unworthy of her, but of course racks and thumbscrews
should not draw from me the slightest intimation of the
kind, in her presence.</p>

<p>So matters went on for some weeks. But sometimes it
happens when a young fellow has long wandered in a beautiful
dream of this kind, a sudden and harsh light of reality
and of common-sense, every-day life, is thrown upon him
in an unforeseen moment; and this moment at last arrived
for me.</p>

<p>One evening, when I dropped in for a call at the Van
Arsdel mansion, the young ladies were all out at a concert,
but Mrs. Van Arsdel was at home, and for some reason,
unusually bland and motherly.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Henderson," she said, "it is rather hard on
you to be obliged to accept an old woman like me, as a substitute
for youth and beauty; but really, I am not sorry, on
the whole, that the girls are out, for I would like a little
chance of having a free, confidential talk with you. Your
relations with us have been so intimate and kindly, I feel,
you know, quite as if you were one of us."</p>

<p>I replied, of course, that 'I was extremely flattered and
gratified by her kindness,' and assured her with effusion,
and if I mistake not, with tears in my eyes, that 'she had
made me forget that I was a stranger in New York, and
that I should always cherish the most undying recollection
of the kindness that I had received in her family, and of
the pleasant hours I had spent there.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, yes, indeed!" she said, "Mr. Henderson, it is pleasant
to me to think that you feel so. I like to give young
men a <em>home</em> feeling. But after all," she continued, "one
feels a little pensive once in a while, in thinking that one
cannot always keep the home-circle unbroken. Indeed, I
never could see how some mothers could seem to rejoice
as they do in the engagement of their daughters. There
is Mrs. Elmore, now, her feelings are perfectly inexplicable
to me."</p>

<p>I assured her that I was quite of her way of thinking,
and agreed with her perfectly.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "as the time comes on, when I begin to
think of parting with Eva, though to the very best man in
the world, do you know, Mr. Henderson, it really makes me
feel sad?"</p>

<p>I began at this moment to find the drift of the conversation
becoming very embarrassing and disagreeable to me,
but I mustered my energies to keep up my share in it with
a becoming degree of interest.</p>

<p>"I am to understand, then," said I, forcing a smile,
"that Miss Eva's engagement with Mr. Sydney is a settled
fact?"</p>

<p>"Well, virtually so," she replied. "Eva is averse to the
publicity of public announcements; but&mdash;you know how
it is, Mr. Henderson, there are relations which amount to
the same thing as an engagement." Here Mrs. Van Arsdel
leaned back on the sofa and drew a letter from her pocket,
while the words of my part of the conversation did not
seem to be forthcoming. I sat in embarrassed silence.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Mr. Henderson," she said, settling the
diamonds and emeralds on her white, shapely fingers, "I
have received a letter to-day from Mr. Sidney,&mdash;he is a noble
fellow," she added, with empressment.</p>

<p>I secretly wished the noble fellow at Kamtschatka, but I
said, in sympathetic tones, "Ah, indeed?" as if waiting for
the farther communication, which I perceived she was
determined to bestow on me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "he is coming to New York in a short
time, and then, I suppose, there is no doubt that all will be
finally arranged. I confess to you I have the weakness to
feel a little depressed about it. Did you ever read Jean
Ingelow's <cite>Songs of Seven</cite>, Mr. Henderson? I think she
touches so beautifully on the trials of mothers in giving up
their daughters?"</p>

<p>I said, "I only trust that Mr. Sydney is in some degree
worthy of Miss Van Arsdel; though," I added with warmth,
"no man can be wholly so."</p>

<p>"Eva is a good girl," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, "and I
must confess that the parting from her will be the greatest
trial of my life. But I thought I would let you know how
matters stood, because of the very great confidence which
we feel in you."</p>

<p>I found presence of mind to acknowledge politely my
sense of the honor conferred. Mrs. Van Arsdel continued
playing prettily with her rings.</p>

<p>"One thing more perhaps I ought to say, Mr. Henderson,
while your intimacy in our family is and has been
quite what I desire, yet you know people are so absurd,
and will say such absurd things, that it might not be out
of the way to suggest a little caution; you know one
wouldn't want to give rise to any reports that might be
unpleasant&mdash;anything, you know, that might reach Mr.
Sydney's ear&mdash;you understand me."</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Van Arsdel, is it possible that anything
has been said?"</p>

<p>"Now, now, don't agitate yourself, Mr. Henderson; I
know what you are going to say&mdash;no, nothing of the kind.
But you know that we elderly people, who know the world
and just what stupid and unreasonable things people are
always saying, sometimes have to give you young folks
just the slightest little caution. Your conduct in this family
has been all that is honorable, and gentlemanly, and unexceptionable,
Mr. Henderson, and such as would lead us to
repose the most perfect confidence in you. In fact, I beg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
you to consider this communication with regard to Eva's
connection with Mr. Sydney, as quite in confidence."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall do so," said I, rising to take my leave,
with much the same sort of eagerness with which one rises
from a dentist's chair, after having his nerves picked at.
As at this moment the voices of the returning party broke
up our interview, I immediately arose, and excusing myself
with the plea of an article to finish, left the house and
walked home in a state of mind as disagreeable as my worst
enemy could have wished. Like all delicate advisers who
are extremely fearful of hurting your feelings, Mrs. Van
Arsdel had told me nothing definite, and yet had said
enough to make me supremely uncomfortable. What did
she mean, and how much did she mean? Had there been
reports? Was this to be received as an intimation from
Eva herself? Had she discovered the state of my feelings,
and was she, through her mother, warning me of my
danger?</p>

<p>All my little romance seemed disenchanted. These illusions
of love are like the legends of hidden treasures
guarded by watchful spirits which disappear from you
if you speak a word; or like an enchanting dream, which
vanishes if you start and open your eyes. I tossed to and
fro restlessly all night, and resolved to do precisely the
most irrational thing that I could have done, under the
circumstances, and that was to give up going to the Van
Arsdel house, and to see Eva no more.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, showed me that I could not
make so striking a change in my habits without subjecting
myself to Jim Fellows' remarks and inquiry. I resolved on
a course of gradual emancipation and detachment.</p>


<p class="center">[Eva Van Arsdel to Isabel Convers.]</p>

<p><i>My Dearest Belle</i>:&mdash;Since I wrote to you last there have
been the strangest changes. I scarcely know what to think.
You remember I told you all about Easter Eve, and a certain
person's appearance, and about the stolen glove and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
that. Your theory of accounting for all this was precisely
mine; in fact I could think of no other. And, Belle, if I
could only see you I could tell you of a thousand little
things that make me certain that he cares for me more than
in the way of mere friendship. I thought I could not be
mistaken in that. There has been scarcely a day since our
acquaintance began when I have not in some way seen him
or heard from him; you know all those early services, when
he was as constant as the morning, and always walked
home with me; then, he and Jim Fellows always spend
at least one evening in a week at our house, and there
are no end of accidental meetings. For example, when we
take our afternoon drives at Central Park we are sure to
see them sitting on the benches watching us go by, and it
came to be quite a regular thing when we stopped the carriage
at the terrace and got out to walk to find them there,
and then Alice would go off with Jim Fellows, and Mr. H.
and I would stroll up and down among the lilac hedges and
in all those lovely little nooks and dells that are so charming.
I'm quite sure I never explored the treasures of the
Park as I have this Spring. We have rambled everywhere&mdash;up
hill and down dale&mdash;it certainly is the loveliest and
most complete imitation of wild nature that ever art perfected.
One could fancy one's self deep in the country in
some parts of it; far from all the rush and whirl and
frivolity of this great, hot, dizzy New York. You may
imagine that with all this we have had opportunity to
become very intimate. He has told me all about himself,
all the history of his life, all about his mother, and his
home; it seems hardly possible that one friend could speak
more unreservedly to another, and I, dear Belle, have
found myself speaking with equal frankness to him. We
know each other so perfectly that there has for a long time
seemed to be only a thin impalpable cob-web barrier between
us; but you know, Belle, that airy filmy barrier is
something that one would not by a look or a word disturb.
For weeks I have felt every day that surely the next time
we meet all this must come to a crisis. That he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
say in words what he says in looks&mdash;in involuntary actions&mdash;what
in fact I am perfectly sure of. Till he speaks I must
be guarded. I must hold myself back from showing him
the kindly interest I really feel. For I am proud, as you
know, Belle, and have always held the liberty of my heart
as a sacred treasure. I have always felt a secret triumph in
the consciousness that I did not care for anybody, and that
my happiness was wholly in my own hands, and I mean
to keep it so. Our friendship is a pleasant thing enough,
but I am not going to let it become too necessary, you
understand. It isn't that I care so very much, but my <em>curiosity</em>
is really excited to know just what the real state of
the case is; one wants to investigate interesting phenomena
you know. When I saw that little glove movement
on Easter Eve I confess I thought the game all in my own
hands, and that I could quietly wait to say "checkmate"
in due form and due time; but after all nothing came of it;
that is, nothing decisive; and I confess I didn't know what
to think. Sometimes I have fancied some obstacle or entanglement
or commitment with some other woman&mdash;this
Cousin Caroline perhaps&mdash;but he talks about her to me in
the most open and composed manner. Sometimes I fancy
he has heard the report of my engagement to Sydney. If
he has, why doesn't he ask me about it? I have no objection
to telling him, but I certainly shall not open the subject
myself. Perhaps, as Ida thinks, he is proud and poor
and not willing to be a suitor to a rich young good-for-nothing.
Well, that can't be helped, he <em>must</em> be a suitor if
he wins me, for <em>I</em> shan't be; <em>he</em> must ask <em>me</em>, for I certainly
shan't ask him, that's settled. If he would "ask
me pretty," now, who knows what nice things he might
hear? I would tell him, <em>perhaps</em>, how much more one true
noble heart is worth in my eyes than all that Wat Sydney
has to give. Sometimes I am quite provoked with him
that he should look so much, and yet say no more, and I
feel a naughty wicked inclination to flirt with somebody
else just to make him open those "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grands yeux</i>" of his a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
little wider and to a little better purpose. Sometimes I
begin to feel a trifle vindictive and as if I should like to
give him a touch of the claw. The claw, my dear, the little
pearly claw that we women keep in reserve in the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patte
de velours</i>," our only and most sacred weapon of defense.</p>

<p>The other night, at Mrs. Cerulean's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i>, she was holding
forth with great effect on woman's right to court men&mdash;as
natural and indefeasible&mdash;and I told her that I considered
our right to <em>be</em> courted far more precious and
inviolable. Of course it is so. The party that makes the
proposals is the party that must take the risk of refusal,
and who would wish to do that? It puts me out of all
patience just to think of it. If there is anything that vexes
me it is that a man should ever feel sure that a woman's
heart is at his disposal before he has asked for it prettily
and properly in all due form, and, my dear, I have the fear
of this before my eyes, even in our most intimate moments.
He shall not feel too sure of me.</p>


<p class="right">
<i>Wednesday Evening</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>My dear Belle, I can't think what in the world is up now;
but something or other has happened to a certain person
that has changed all our relations. For more than a week
I have scarcely seen him. He called with Jim Fellows on
the usual evening, but did not go into Ida's room, and
hardly came near me, and seemed all in a flutter to leave
all the time. He was at the great Elmore wedding, and so
was I, but we scarcely spoke all the evening. I could see
him following all my motions and watching me at a distance,
but as sure as I came into a room he seemed in a perfect
flutter to get out of it, and yet no sooner had he done so
than he secured some position where he could observe me
at a distance. I was provoked enough, and I thought if
my lord wanted to observe, I'd give him something to see,
so I flirted with Jerrold Livingstone, whom I don't care a
copper about, within an inch of his life, and I made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
special effort to be agreeable to all the danglers and
moustaches that I usually take delight in snubbing, and
I could see that he looked quite wretched, which was a
comfort&mdash;but yet he wouldn't come near me till just as I
was going to leave, when he came to beg I would stay
longer and declared that he hadn't seen anything of me.
It was a little too much! I assumed an innocent air and
surveyed him "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de haut en bas</i>" and said, "Why, dear me,
Mr. Henderson, possible that <em>you've</em> been here all this time?
Where have you kept yourself?" and then I handed my bouquet
to Livingstone and swept by in triumph; his last look
after me as I went down stairs was tragical, you may
believe. Well, I can't make him out, but I don't care. I
won't care. He was free to come. He shall be free to go;
but isn't it vexatious that in cases of this kind one cannot
put an end to the tragedy by a simple common-sense question?</p>

<p>One doesn't care so very much, you know, <em>what</em> is the
matter with these creatures, only one is <em>curious</em> to know
what upon earth makes them <em>act</em> so. A man sets up a
friendship with you, and then looks and acts as if he
adored you, as if he worshiped the ground you tread on,
and then is off at a tangent with a tragedy air, and you are
not allowed to say "My dear sir, why do you behave so?
why do you make such a precious goose of yourself?"</p>

<p>The fact is, these friendships of women with men are all
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fol-de-rol</i>. The creatures always have an advantage over
you. They can make every advance and come nearer and
nearer and really make themselves quite agreeable, not to
say necessary, and then suddenly change the whole footing
and one cannot even ask why. One cannot say, as to
another woman, "What is the matter? what has altered
your manner?" She cannot even show that she notices the
change, without loss of self-respect. A woman in friendship
with a man is made heartless by this very necessity,
she must always hold herself ready to change hands and
make her chassé to right or left with all suitable indifference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
whenever her partner is ready for another move in the
cotillion.</p>

<p>Well, so be it. I fancy I can do this as well as another.
<em>I</em> never shall inquire into his motives. I'm sorry
for him, too, for he looked quite haggard and unhappy.
Well; it's his own fault; for if he would only be open with
me he'd find it to his advantage&mdash;<em>perhaps</em>.</p>

<p>You are quite mistaken, dear, in what you have heard
about his belonging to that radical party of strange creatures
who rant and rage about progress in our times. Like
all generous, magnanimous men, who are conscious of
strength, he sympathizes with the weak, and is a champion
of woman wherever she is wronged; and certainly in many
respects, we must all admit women are wronged by the
laws and customs of society. But no man could be nicer
in his sense of feminine delicacy and more averse to associating
with bold and unfeminine women than he. I must
defend him there. I am sure that nothing could be more
distasteful to him than the language and conduct of many
of these dreadful female reformers of our day. If I <em>am</em> out
of sorts with him I must at least do him this justice.</p>

<p>You inquire about Alice and Jim Fellows; my dear, there
can be nothing there. They are perfectly well matched; a
pair of flirts, and neither trusts the other an inch farther
than they can see. Alice has one of those characters that
lie in layers like the geologic strata that our old professor
used to show us. The top layer is all show, and display and
ambition; dig down below that and you find a warm volcanic
soil where noble plants might cast root. But at present
she is all in the upper stratum. She must have her run
of flirting and fashion and adventure, and just now a
splendid marriage is her ideal, but she is capable of a great
deal in the depths of her nature. All I hope is she will not
marry till she has got down into it, but she is starting under
full sail now, coquetting to right and left, making great
slaughter.</p>

<p>She looked magnificently at the wedding and quite outshone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
me. She has that superb Spanish style of beauty
which promises to wear well and bloom out into more splendor
as time goes on, and she has a good heart with all her
nonsense.</p>

<p>Well, dear, what a long letter! and must I add to it the
account of the wedding glories&mdash;lists of silver and gold tea
sets, and sets of pearls and diamonds? My dear, only fancy
Tiffany's counters transferred bodily, with cards from A.,
B., and C., presenting this and that; fancy also the young
men of your acquaintance silly-drunk, or stupid-drunk in
the latter part of the night in the supper-room; fancy, if
you can, the bridegroom carried up stairs, because he
couldn't go up on his own feet!&mdash;this is a wedding! Never
mind! the bride had three or four sets of diamond shoe-buckles,
and rubies and emeralds in the profusion of the
Arabian Nights. Well, it will be long before I care for such
a wedding! I am sick of splendors, sated with nick-nacks,
my doll is stuffed with saw-dust, &amp;c., &amp;c., but I shall ever
be your loving</p>

<p class="smcap right">Eva.
</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;My Dear&mdash;A case of conscience!&mdash;Would it be a sin
to flirt a little with Sydney, just enough to aggravate somebody
else? Sydney's, you mind, is not a deep heart-case.
He only wants me because I am hard to catch, and have
been the fashion. I'll warrant him against breaking his
heart for anybody. However, I don't believe I will flirt
after all I'll&mdash;try some other square of the chess-board.</p>

<p>The confidential conversation held with me by Mrs. Van
Arsdel had all the effect on my mental castle-building
that a sudden blow had on Alnaschar's basket of glass ware
in the Arabian tales.</p>

<p>Nobody is conscious how far he has been in dreamland till
he is awakened. I was now fully aroused to the fact that
I was in love with Eva Van Arsdel, to all intents and purposes,
so much in love as made the nourishing and cherishing
of an intimate friendship an impossibility, and only a
specious cloak for a sort of moral dishonesty. Now I
might have known this fact in the beginning, and I scolded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and lectured myself for my own folly in not confessing it
to myself before. I had been received by the family as a
friend. I had been trusted with their chief treasure, with
the understanding that it was to belong not to me but
another, and there was a species of moral indelicacy to
my mind in having suffered myself to become fascinated by
her as I now felt that I was. But I did not feel adequate
to congratulating her as the betrothed bride of another
man; nay, more, when I looked back on the kind of intimate
and confidential relations that had been growing up
between us, I could not but feel that it was not safe
for me to continue them. Two natures cannot exactly
accord, cannot keep time and tune together, without being
conscious of the fact and without becoming necessary to
each other; and such relations in their very nature tend to
grow absorbing and exclusive. It was plain to me that if
Eva were to marry Wat Sydney I could not with honor and
safety continue the kind of intimacy we had been so
thoughtlessly and so delightfully enjoying for the past few
weeks.</p>

<p>But how to break it off without an explanation, and how
make that explanation? There is a certain responsibility
resting on a man of conscience and honor, about accepting
all that nearness of access, and that closeness of intimacy
which the ignorant innocence of young girls often invites.
From his very nature, from his education, from his position
in society, a young man knows more of what the full
significance and requirements of marriage are to be than a
young woman can, and he must know the danger of absorbing
and exclusive intimacy with other than a husband. The
instincts of every man teach that marriage must be engrossing
and monopolizing, that it implies a forsaking of all others,
and a keeping unto one only; and how could that be
when every taste and feeling, every idiosyncracy and individual
peculiarity made the society of some other person
more agreeable?</p>

<p>Without undue personal vanity, a man will surely know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
when there is a special congeniality of nature between
himself and a certain woman, and he is bound in conscience
and honor to look ahead in all his intimacies and see what
must be the inevitable result of them according to the laws
of the human mind. Because I had neglected this caution,
because I had yielded myself blindly to the delicious enchantment
of a new enthusiasm, I had now come to a place
where I knew neither how to advance nor recede.</p>

<p>I could not drop this intimacy, so dangerous to my peace
and honor, without risk of offending; to explain was, in
fact, to solicit. I might confess all, cast myself at her feet&mdash;but
supposing she should incline to mercy&mdash;and with
a woman's uncalculating disinterestedness accept my love
in place of wealth and station, what should I then do?</p>

<p>Had I been possessed of a fortune even half equal to Mr.
Sydney's; had I, in fact, any settled and assumed position
to offer, I would have avowed my love boldly and suffered
her to decide. But I had no advantage to stand on. I
was poor, and had nothing to give but myself; and what
man is vain enough to think that he is in himself enough to
make up for all that may be wanting in externals?</p>

<p>Besides this, Eva was the daughter of a rich family,
and an offer of marriage from me must have appeared to
all the world the interested proposal of a fortune-hunter.
Of what avail would it be under such circumstances to
plead that I loved her for herself alone? I could fancy
the shout of incredulous laughter with which the suggestion
would be received in the gay world.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent1">"So very thoughtful of the fair!</div>
      <div class="verse">It showed a true fraternal care.</div>
      <div class="verse">Five thousand guineas in her purse&mdash;</div>
      <div class="verse">The fellow might have fancied worse."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now, if there was anything that my pride revolted from
as an impossibility, it was coming as a poor suitor to a great
rich family. Were I even sure that Eva loved me, how
could I do that? Would not all the world say that to
make use of my access in the family to draw her down from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
a splendid position in life to poverty and obscurity was on
my part a dishonorable act? Could I trust myself enough
to feel that it was justice to her?</p>

<p>The struggle that a young man has to engage in to secure
a self-supporting position, is of a kind to make him keenly
alive to material values. Dr. Franklin said, "If you would
learn the value of money, try to borrow some." I would
say rather, Try to earn some, and to live only on what you
earn. My own hard experience on this subject led me to
reflect very seriously on the responsibility which a man
incurs in inducing a woman of refinement and culture to
look to him as her provider.</p>

<p>In our advanced state of society there are a thousand absolute
wants directly created by culture and refinement; and
whatever may be said about the primary importance of personal
affection and sympathy as the foundation of a happy
marriage, it is undoubtedly true that a certain amount of
pecuniary ease and security is necessary as a background on
which to develop agreeable qualities. A man and woman
much driven, care-worn, and overtaxed, often have little that
is agreeable to show to each other. I queried with myself
then, whether, as Eva's true friend, I should not wish that
she might marry a respectable man, devoted to her, who
could keep her in all that elegance and luxury she was
so fitted to adorn and enjoy; and whether if I <em>could</em> do it,
I ought to try to put myself in his place in her mind.</p>

<p>A man who detects himself in an unfortunate passion
has always the refuge of his life-object. To the true man,
the thing that he hopes to <em>do</em> always offers some compensation
for the thing he ceases to enjoy.</p>

<p>It was fortunate therefore for me, that just in this crisis
of my life, my friendship with Bolton opened before me
the prospect of a permanent establishment in connection
with the literary press of the times.</p>

<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_h.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">"Henderson,"</span> said Bolton to me, one day, "how
long are you engaged on the <cite>Democracy?</cite>"</p>

<p>"Only for this year," said I.</p>

<p>"Because," said he, "I have something to propose to you
which I hope may prove a better thing. Hestermann &amp;
Co. sent for me yesterday in secret session. The head manager
of their whole set of magazines and papers has resigned,
and is going to travel in Europe, and they want me to
take the place."</p>

<p>"Good! I am heartily glad of it," said I. "I always
felt that you were not in the position that you ought to have.
You will accept, of course."</p>

<p>"Whether I accept or not depends on <em>you</em>," he replied.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand," said I.</p>

<p>"In short, then," said he, "the responsibility is a heavy
one, and I cannot undertake it without a partner whom I
can trust as myself&mdash;I mean," he added, "whom I can trust
<em>more</em> than myself."</p>

<p>"You are a thousand times too good," said I. "I should
like nothing better than such a partnership, but I feel oppressed
by your good opinion. Are you sure that I am the
one for you?"</p>

<p>"I think I am," said he, "and it is a case where I am the
best judge; and it offers to you just what you want&mdash;a stable
position, independence to express yourself, and a good income.
Hestermann &amp; Co. are rich, and wise enough to
know that liberality is the best policy."</p>

<p>"But," said I, "their offers are made to you, and not to
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, of course, their acquaintance with me is of old
standing; but I have spoken to them of you, and I am to
bring you round to talk with them to-morrow; but, after
all, the whole power of arranging is left with me. They
put a certain sum at my disposal, and I do what I please
with it. In short," he said, smiling, "I hold the living, and
you are my curate. Well," he added, "of course you need
time to think matters over; here is paper on which I have
made a little memorandum of an arrangement between us;
take it and dream on it, and let me know to-morrow what
you think of it."</p>

<p>I went to my room and unfolded the agreement, and found
the terms liberal beyond all my expectations. In fact, the
income of the principal was awarded to me, and that of
the subordinate to Bolton.</p>

<p>I took the paper the next evening to Bolton's room.
"Look here, Bolton," said I, "these terms are simply
absurd."</p>

<p>"How so?" he said, lifting his eyes tranquilly from his
book. "What's the matter with them?"</p>

<p>"Why, you give me all the income."</p>

<p>"Wait till you see how I'll work you," he said, smiling.
"I'll get it out of you; you see if I don't."</p>

<p>"But you leave yourself nothing."</p>

<p>"I have as much as I would have, and that's enough.
I'm a literary monk, you know, with no family but Puss
and Stumpy, poor fellow, and I need the less."</p>

<p>Stumpy upon this pricked up his ragged ears with an
expression of lively satisfaction, sat back on his haunches,
and rapped the floor with his forlorn bit of a tail.</p>

<p>"Poor Stumpy," said Bolton, "you don't know that you
are the homeliest dog in New York, do you? Well, <em>as far
as you go</em>, you are perfect goodness, Stumpy, though you
are no beauty."</p>

<p>Upon this high praise, Stumpy seemed so elated that he
stood on his hind paws and rested his rough fore-feet on
Bolton's knee, and looked up with eyes of admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"Man is the dog's God," said Bolton. "I can't conceive
how any man can be rude to his dog. A dog," he added,
fondling his ragged cur, "why, he's nothing but organized
love&mdash;love on four feet, encased in fur, and looking piteously
out at the eyes&mdash;love that would die for you, yet cannot
speak&mdash;that's the touching part. Stumpy <em>longs</em> to speak;
his poor dog's breast heaves with something he longs to tell
me and can't. Don't it, Stumpy?"</p>

<p>As if he understood his master, Stumpy wheezed a doleful
whine, and actual tears stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bolton, "Stumpy has beautiful eyes; nobody
shall deny that&mdash;there, there! poor fellow, maybe on
the other shore your rough bark will develop into speech;
let's hope so. I confess I'm of the poor Indian's mind, and
hope to meet my dog in the hereafter. Why should so much
love go out in nothing? Yes, Stumpy, we'll meet in the
resurrection, won't we?" Stumpy barked aloud with the
greatest animation.</p>

<p>"Bolton, you ought to be a family man," said I. "Why
do you take it for granted that you are to be a literary
monk, and spend your love on dogs and cats?"</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> may get married, Hal, and I'll adopt your children,"
said Bolton; "that's one reason why I want to establish
you. You see, one's dogs <em>will</em> die, and it breaks one's heart.
If <em>you</em> had a boy, now, I'd invest in him."</p>

<p>"And why can't you invest in a boy of your own?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm a predestined old bachelor."</p>

<p>"No such thing," I persisted, hardily, "Why do you
immure yourself in a den? Why won't you go out into
society? Here, ever since I've known you, you have been
in this one cave&mdash;a New York hermit; yet if you would
once begin to go into society, you'd like it."</p>

<p>"You think I haven't tried it; you forget that I am some
years older than you are," said Bolton.</p>

<p>"You are a good-looking young fellow yet," said I, "and
ought to make the most of yourself. Why should you turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
all the advantages into my hands, and keep so little for
yourself?"</p>

<p>"It suits me," said Bolton; "I am lazy&mdash;I mean to get the
work out of you."</p>

<p>"That's all hum," said I; "you know well enough that
you are not lazy; you take delight in work for work's sake."</p>

<p>"One reason I am glad of this position," he said, "is that
it gives me a chance to manage matters a little, as I want
them. For instance, there's Jim Fellows&mdash;I want to make
something more than a mad Bohemian of that boy. Jim is
one of the wild growths of our New York life; he is a creature
of the impulses and the senses, and will be for good or
evil according as others use him."</p>

<p>"He's capital company," said I, "but he doesn't seem to
me to have a serious thought on any subject."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Bolton, "such is our day and time, that
Jim is more likely than you or I to get along in the world.
His cap and bells win favor everywhere, and the laugh he
raises gives him the privilege of saying anything he pleases.
For my part, I couldn't live without Jim. I have a weakness
for him. Nothing is so precious to me as a laugh, and,
wet or dry, I can always get that out of Jim. He'll work
in admirably with us."</p>

<p>"One thing must be said for Jim," said I, "with all his
keenness he's kind-hearted. He never is witty at the expense
of real trouble. As he says, he goes for the under dog
in the fight always, and his cheery, frisky, hit-or-miss
morality does many a kind turn for the unfortunate, while
he is always ready to help the poor."</p>

<p>"Jim is not of the sort that is going to do the world's
thinking for them," said Bolton; "neither will he ever be
one of the noble army of martyrs for principle. He is like
a lively, sympathetic horse that will keep the step of the
team he is harnessed in, and in the department of lively
nonsense he'd do us yeoman service. Nowadays people
must have truth whipped up to a white froth or they won't
touch it. Jim is a capital egg-beater."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "he's like the horse that had the <span class="smcap">GO</span> in him;
he'll run any team that he's harnessed in, and if you hold
the reins he won't run off the course."</p>

<p>"Then again," said Bolton, "there's your cousin; there is
the editorship of our weekly journal will be just the place
for her. You can write and offer it to her."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said I, maliciously, "since you are acquainted
with the lady, why not write and offer it yourself?
It would be a good chance to renew your acquaintance."</p>

<p>Bolton's countenance changed, and he remained a moment
silent.</p>

<p>"Henderson," he said, "there are very painful circumstances
connected with my acquaintance with your cousin.
I never wish to meet her, or renew my acquaintance with
her. Sometime I will tell you why," he added.</p>

<p>The next evening I found on my table the following letter
from Bolton:</p>

<p><i>Dear Henderson</i>:&mdash;You need feel no hesitancy about accepting
in full every advantage in the position I propose
to you, since you may find it weighted with disadvantages
and incumbrances you do not dream of. In short, I shall
ask of you services for which no money can pay, and till
I knew you there was no man in the world of whom I had
dared to ask them. I want a friend, courageous, calm, and
true, capable of thinking broadly and justly, one superior
to ordinary prejudices, who may be to me another, and in
some hours a stronger, self.</p>

<p>I can fancy your surprise at this language, and yet I have
not read you aright if you are not one of a thousand on
whom I may rest this hope.</p>

<p>You often rally me on my lack of enterprise and ambition,
on my hermit habits. The truth is, Henderson, I am
a strained and unseaworthy craft, for whom the harbor
and shore are the safest quarters. I have lost trust in
myself, and dare not put out to sea without feeling the
strong hand of a friend with me.</p>

<p>I suppose no young fellow ever entered the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
life with more self-confidence. I had splendid health, high
spirits, great power of application, and great social powers.
I lived freely and carelessly on the abundance of my physical
resources. I could ride, and row, and wrestle with the
best. I could lead in all social gaieties, yet keep the head
of my class, as I did the first two years of my college life.
It seems hardly fair to us human beings that we should be
so buoyed up with ignorant hope and confidence in the beginning
of our life, and that we should be left in our ignorance
to make mistakes which no after years can retrieve.
I thought I was perfectly sure of myself; I thought my
health and strength were inexhaustible, and that I could
carry weights that no man else could. The drain of my
wide-awake exhausting life upon my nervous system I made
up by the insidious use of stimulants. I was like a man
habitually overdrawing his capital, and ignorant to what
extent. In my third college year this began to tell perceptibly
on my nerves. I was losing self-control, losing my
way in life; I was excitable, irritable, impatient of guidance
or reproof, and at times horribly depressed. I sought
refuge from this depression in social exhilaration, and
having lost control of myself became a marked man among
the college authorities; in short, I was overtaken in a convivial
row, brought under college discipline, and suspended.</p>

<p>It was at this time that I went into your neighborhood to
study and teach. I found no difficulty in getting the highest
recommendations as to scholarship from some of the
college officers who were for giving me a chance to recover
myself; and for the rest I was thoroughly sobered and
determined on a new course. Here commenced my acquaintance
with your cousin, and there followed a few
months remembered ever since as the purest happiness of
my life. I loved her with all there was in me,&mdash;heart, soul,
mind and strength,&mdash;with a love which can never die. She
also loved me, more perhaps than she dared to say, for she
was young, hardly come to full consciousness of herself.
She was then scarcely sixteen, ignorant of her own nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
ignorant of life, and almost frightened at the intensity of
the feeling which she excited in me, yet she loved me. But
before we could arrive at anything like a calm understanding,
her father came between us. He was a trustee of the
Academy, and a dispute arose between him and me in which
he treated me with an overbearing haughtiness which aroused
the spirit of opposition in me. I was in the right and
knew I was, and I defended my course before the other
trustees in a manner which won them over to my way of
thinking&mdash;a victory which he never forgave.</p>

<p>Previously to this encounter I had been in the habit of
visiting in his family quite intimately. Caroline and I
enjoyed that kind of unwatched freedom which the customs
of New England allow to young people. I always attended
her home from the singing-school and the weekly lectures,
and the evening after my encounter with the trustees I did
the same. At the door of his house he met us, and as Caroline
passed in he stopped me, and briefly saying that my
visits there would no longer be permitted, closed the door
in my face. I tried to obtain an interview soon after, when
he sternly upbraided me as one that had stolen into the
village and won their confidence on false pretences, adding
that if he and the trustees had known the full history of
my college life I should never have been permitted to teach
in their village or have access to their families. It was in
vain to attempt a defense to a man determined to take the
very worst view of facts which I did not pretend to deny.
I knew that I had been irreproachable as to my record in
the school, that I had been faithful in my duties, that the
majority of parents and pupils were on my side; but I could
not deny the harsh facts which he had been enabled to
obtain from some secret enemy, and which he thought justified
him in saying that he would rather see his daughter
in her grave than to see her my wife. The next day Caroline
did not appear in school. Her father, with prompt
energy, took her immediately to an academy fifty miles
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not attempt to follow her or write to her; a profound
sense of discouragement came over me, and I looked
on my acquaintance with her with a sort of remorse.
The truth bitterly told by an enemy with a vivid power
of statement is a tonic oftentimes too strong for one's power
of endurance. I never reflected so seriously on the
responsibility which a man assumes, in awakening the
slumbering feelings of a woman, and fixing them on himself.
Under the reproaches of Caroline's father I could
but regard this as a wrong I had done, and which could be
expiated only by leaving her to peace in forgetfulness.</p>

<p>I resolved that I would never let her hear from me again,
till I had fully proved myself to be possessed of such
powers of self-control as would warrant me in offering to
be the guardian of her happiness.</p>

<p>But when I set myself to the work, I found what many
another does, that I had reckoned without my host. The
man who has begun to live and work by artificial stimulant,
never knows where he stands, and can never count
upon himself with any certainty. He lets into his castle a
servant who becomes the most tyrannical of masters. He
may resolve to turn him out, but will find himself reduced
to the condition in which he can neither do with nor without
him.</p>

<p>In short, the use of stimulant to the brain-power brings on
a disease, in whose paroxysms a man is no more his own
master than in the ravings of fever, a disease that few have
the knowledge to understand, and for whose manifestations
the world has no pity.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you the dire despair that came upon me,
when after repeated falls, bringing remorse and self-upbraiding
to me, and drawing upon me the severest reproaches
of my friends, the idea at last flashed upon me that I had
indeed become the victim of a sort of periodical insanity
in which the power of the will was overwhelmed by a wild
unreasoning impulse. I remember when a boy reading an
account of a bridal party sailing gaily on the coast of Norway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
who were insidiously drawn into the resistless outer
whirl of the great Maelström. The horror of the situation
was the moment when the shipmaster learned that the
ship <em>no longer obeyed the rudder</em>; the cruelty of it was the
gradual manner in which the resistless doom came upon
them. The sun still shone, the sky was still blue. The
shore, with its green trees and free birds and blooming
flowers, was near and visible as they went round and round
in dizzy whirls, past the church with its peaceful spire,
past the home cottages, past the dwelling of friends and
neighbors, past parents, brothers, and sisters who stood on
the shore warning and shrieking and entreating; helpless,
hopeless, with bitterness in their souls, with all that made
life lovely so near in sight, and yet cut off from it by the
swirl of that tremendous fate!</p>

<p>There have been just such hours to me, in which I have
seen the hopes of manhood, the love of woman, the possession
of a home, the opportunities for acquisition of name,
and position, and property, all within sight, within grasp,
yet all made impossible by my knowledge and consciousness
of the deadly drift and suction of that invisible
whirlpool.</p>

<p>The more of manliness there yet is left in man in these
circumstances, the more torture. The more sense of honor,
love of reputation, love of friends, conscience in duty,
the more anguish. I read once a frightful story of a woman
whose right hand was changed to a serpent, which at
intervals was roused to fiendish activity and demanded
of her the blood of her nearest and dearest friends. The
hideous curse was inappeasable, and the doomed victim
spell-bound, powerless to resist. Even so the man who has
lost the control of his will is driven to torture those he
loves, while he shivers with horror and anguish at the
sight.</p>

<p>I have seen the time when I gave earnest thanks that
no woman loved me, that I had no power to poison the
life of a wife with the fear, and terror, and lingering agony
of watching the slow fulfillment of such a doom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>It is enough to say that with every advantage&mdash;of friends,
patronage, position&mdash;I lost <em>all</em>.</p>

<p>The world is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">exigéant</i>. It demands above everything that
every man shall keep step. He who cannot, falls to the rear,
and is gradually left behind as the army moves on.</p>

<p>The only profession left to me was one which could avail
itself of my lucid intervals.</p>

<p>The power of clothing thought with language is in our
day growing to be a species of talent for which men are
willing to pay, and I have been able by this to make myself
a name and a place in the world; and what is more, I hope
to do some good in it.</p>

<p>I have reflected upon my own temptation, endeavoring
to divest myself of the horror with which my sense of the
suffering and disappointment I have caused my friends
inspires me. I have settled in my own mind the limits of
human responsibility on this subject, and have come to
the conclusion that it is to be regarded precisely as Mary
Lamb and Charles Lamb regarded the incursion of the mania
which destroyed the peace of their life. A man who
undertakes to comprehend, and cure himself, has to fight
his way back alone. Nobody understands, nobody sympathizes
with him, nobody helps him&mdash;not because the world
is unfeeling, but because it is ignorant of the laws which
govern this species of insanity.</p>

<p>It took me, therefore, a great while to form my system of
self-cure. I still hope for this. <em>I</em>, the sane and sound, <em>I</em>
hope to provide for the insane and unsound intervals of my
life. And my theory is, briefly, a <em>total</em> and <em>eternal</em> relinquishment
of the poisonous influence, so that nature may
have power to organize new and healthy brain-matter, and
to remove that which is diseased. Nature will do this, in
the end, for she is ever merciful; there is always "forgiveness
with her, that she may be feared." Since you
have known me, you have seen that I live the life of an anchorite&mdash;that
my hours are regular, that I avoid exciting
society, that I labor with uniformity, and that I never
touch any stimulating drink. It is a peculiarity of cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
like mine that for lengths of time the morbid disease
leaves us, and we feel the utmost aversion to any thing of
the kind. But there is always a danger lying behind this
subtle calm. Three or four drops of alcohol, such as form
the basis of a tincture which a doctor will order without
scruple, will bring back the madness. One five-minutes
inadvertence will upset the painful work of years, and carry
one away as with a flood. When I did not know this, I was
constantly falling. Society through all its parts is full of
traps and pitfalls for such as I, and the only refuge is in
flight.</p>

<p>It has been part of my rule of life to avoid all responsibilities
that might involve others in my liability to failure.
It is now a very long time since I have felt any abnormal
symptoms, and if I had not so often been thrown down after
such a period of apparent calm, I might fancy my dangers
over, and myself a sound man.</p>

<p>The younger Hestermann was a class-mate and chum of
mine in college, and one whose friendship for me has held
on through thick and thin. He has a trust in me that imposes
on me a painful sense of responsibility. I would not
fail him for a thousand worlds, yet if one of my hours of
darkness should come I should fail ignominiously.</p>

<p>Only one motive determined me to take their offer&mdash;it gave
me a chance to provide for you and for Caroline.</p>

<p>I dare do it only through trusting you for a friendship
beyond that of the common; in short, for a brotherly kindness
such as Charles Lamb showed to Mary, his sister. If
the curse returns upon me, you must not let me ruin myself
and you; you must take me to an asylum till I recover.</p>

<p>In asking this of you, I am glad to be able to offer what will
be to you an independent position, and give you that home
and fireside which I may not dare to hope for myself.</p>

<p>In the end, I expect to conquer, either here or hereafter.
I believe in the Fatherhood of God, and that He has a
purpose even in letting us blindly stumble through life
as we do; and through all my weakness and unworthiness I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
still hold his hand. I <em>know</em> that the whole temptation is one
of brain and nerves, and when He chooses He can release
me. The poor brain will be cold and still for good and all
some day, and <em>I</em> shall be free and able to see, I trust, why I
have been suffered thus to struggle. After all, <em>immortality</em>
opens a large hope, that may overpay the most unspeakable
bitterness of life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you can see why I do not wish to be brought
into personal relations with the only woman I have ever
loved, or ever can love, and whose happiness I fear to put
in peril. It is an unspeakable delight and relief to have
this power of doing for her, but she must not know of it.</p>

<p>Also, let me tell you that you are to me more transparent
than you think. It requires only the penetration of
friendship to see that you are in love, and that you hesitate
and hang back because of an unwillingness to match
your fortunes with hers.</p>

<p>Let me suggest, do you not owe it as a matter of justice,
after so much intimacy as has existed, to give her the opportunity
to choose between a man and circumstances? If the
arrangement between us goes into effect, you will have a
definite position and a settled income. Go to her like a
man and lay it before her, and if she is worthy of you she
will come to you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>Ida's Study&mdash;Ida busy making notes from a book&mdash;
Eva sitting by, embroidering.</i></p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_e.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="E" title="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Eva</span>&mdash;"Heigho! how stupid things are. I am tired
of everything. I am tired of shopping&mdash;tired of
parties&mdash;tired of New York&mdash;where the same thing
keeps happening over and over. I wish I was a man. I'd
just take my carpet-bag and go to Europe. Come now, Ida,
pray stop that, and talk to me, do!"</p>

<p><i>Ida</i>, putting down her book and pen:</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and what about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know!&mdash;this inextricable puzzle&mdash;what does ail
a certain person? Now he didn't come at all last night, and
when I asked Jim Fellows where his friend was (one must
pass the compliment of inquiring, you know), he said,
'Henderson had grown dumpy lately,' and he couldn't
get him out anywhere."</p>

<p>"Well, Eva, I'm sure I can't throw any light on the
subject. I know no more than you."</p>

<p>"Now, Ida, let me tell you, this afternoon when we stopped
in the park, I went into that great rustic arbor on
the top of the hill there, and just as we came in on one
side, I saw him in all haste hurrying out on the other, as
if he were afraid to meet me."</p>

<p>"How very odd!"</p>

<p>"Odd! Well, I should think it was; but what was worse,
he went and stationed himself on a bench under a tree
where he could hear and see us, and there my lord sat&mdash;perhaps
he thought I didn't see him, but I did.</p>

<p>"Lillie and Belle Forrester and Wat Jerrold were with me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and we were having such a laugh! I don't know when I
have had such a frolic, and how silly it was of him to sit
there glowering like an owl in an ivy bush, when he might
have come out and joined us, and had a good time! I'm
quite out of patience with the creature, it's so vexatious
to have him act so!"</p>

<p>"It is vexatious, darling, but then as you can't do anything
about it why think of it?"</p>

<p>"Because I can't help it. Can you have a real friendship
for a person and enjoy his society, and not care in the
least whether you have it or not? Of course you can't.
We were friends&mdash;quite good friends, and I'm not ashamed
to say I miss him, very much, and then to have such an
unaccountable mystery about it. I should think you'd miss
him too."</p>

<p>"I do somewhat," said Ida, "but then you see I have so
much more to think of. I have my regular work every day
for papa, and I have my plan of study, and to say the truth,
so far as I am concerned, though I liked Mr. Henderson
very much, yet I don't miss him."</p>

<p>"Well, Ida, now I want to ask you, didn't you think he
acted as if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As if he were in love with you, you would say."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"He certainly did, if I am any judge of symptoms; but
then, dear, men are often in love with women they don't
mean to marry."</p>

<p>"Who wants to marry him, I should like to know? I'm
not thinking of that."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Eva, perhaps he has discovered that <em>he</em> wants
to marry you; and, perhaps, for some reason he regards
that as impossible, and so is going to try to keep away."</p>

<p>"How perfectly hateful and stupid of him! I'd rather
never have seen him."</p>

<p>"A man generally has this advantage over a woman
in a matter of this sort, that he has an object in life which is
more to him than anything else, and he can fill his whole
mind with that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Ida, that's all very true, but what object in life can
a girl have who lives as we do; who has everything she can
want without an effort&mdash;I for instance."</p>

<p>"But <em>I</em> have an object."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you have, but I am different from you. It
would be as impossible for me to do as you do, as for a fish
to walk upright on dry land."</p>

<p>"Well, Eva, this objectless, rootless, floating kind of life
that you and almost all girls lead, is at the bottom of nearly
all your troubles. Literally and truly you have nothing in
the world to do but to amuse yourselves; the consequence
is that you soon get tired of almost every kind of amusement,
and so every friendship, and flirtation assumes a disproportioned
interest in your minds. There is real danger
now that you may think too much of Mr."&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, stuff and nonsense, Ida! I <em>won't</em>, so there! I'll put
him out of my head forthwith and bolt the door. Give me a
good stiff dose of reading, Ida; one of your dullest scientific
books, and get me to write you an analysis of it as we
did at school. Here, let me see, 'Descent of Man.' Come,
now, I'll sit down and go at it."</p>

<p>Eva sits down with book, pencil and paper, and turns over
the leaves.</p>

<p>"Let's try how it looks. 'Sexual Selection'! Oh, horrid!
'Her Ape-like Proportions'! I should be ashamed
to talk so about my ancestors. Apes!&mdash;of all things&mdash;why
not some more respectable animal? lions or horses, for example.
You remember Swift's story about the houyhnhums.
Isn't this a dreadfully dull book, Ida?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't find it so. I am deeply interested in it,
though I admit it is pretty heavy."</p>

<p>"But, then, Ida, you see it goes against the Bible,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily as I see."</p>

<p>"Why, yes; to be sure. I haven't read it; but Mr. Henderson
gave me the clearest kind of a sketch of the argument,
and that is the way it impressed me. That to be sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
is among the things I principally value him for; he is my
milk-skimmer; he gets all the cream that rises on a book
and presents it to me in a portable form. I remember
one of the very last really comfortable long talks we had;
it was on this subject, and I told him that it seemed to
me that the modern theory and the Bible were point blank
opposites. Instead of men being a <em>fallen</em> race, they are a
<em>rising</em> race, and never so high as now; and then, what becomes
of the Garden of Eden, and St. Paul? Now, for my
part, I told Mr. Henderson I wasn't going to give up all the
splendid poetry of Milton and the Bible, just because Mr.
Darwin took it into his head that it was not improbable
that my seventy fifth millionth grandfather might have
been a big baboon with green nose and pointed ears!"</p>

<p>"My dear Eva, you have capital reasons for believing and
<em>not</em> believing. You believe what seems most agreeable and
poetic."</p>

<p>"Exactly, Ida; and in those far-off regions, sixteen
million billion ages ago, why shouldn't I? Nobody knows
what happened there; nobody has been there to see what
made the first particle of jelly take to living, and turn into
a germ cell, and then go working on like yeast, till it worked
out into all the things we see. I think it a good deal easier
to believe the Garden of Eden story, especially as that is
pretty and poetical, and is in the dear old Book that is so
sweet and comfortable to us; but then Mr. Henderson
insists that even if we do hold the Evolution theory, the old
book will be no less true. I never saw a man of so much
thought who had so much reverence."</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to study Darwin and not
think of him," said Ida.</p>

<p>"Well, somehow, almost every thing puts me in mind of
him, because we have had such long talks about everything;
and, Ida, to tell the truth, I do believe I am intellectually
lazy. I don't like rough hard work, I like polishing and furbishing.
Now, I want a man to go through all this rough,
hard, stupid, disagreeable labyrinth of scientific terms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
pick out the meaning and put it into a few, plain words,
and then I take it and brighten it up and put on the rainbows.
Look here, now, think of my having to scrabble
through a bog like this in the "Origin of the Species":</p>

<p>"'In Carthamus and some other compositæ the central
achenes alone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris
the same head yields achenes of three different forms. In
certain Umbelliferæ the exterior seeds, according to Tanch,
are orthospermous, and the central one c&oelig;lospermous, and
this difference has been considered by De Candolle as of the
highest systematic importance in the family.'</p>

<p>"Now all this is just as unintelligible to me as if it
were written in Choctaw. I don't know enough to know
what it means, and I'm afraid I don't care enough to know.
I want to know the upshot of the whole in good plain
English, and then see whether I can believe it or not; and
isn't it a shame that things are so that one cannot have a sensible
man to be one's guide, philosopher and friend, without
this everlasting marriage question coming up? If a
woman makes an effort to get or keep a valuable friend, she
is supposed to be intriguing and making unfeminine efforts
for a husband. Now this poor man is perfectly wretched
about something&mdash;for I can see he has really gone off shockingly,
and looks thin and haggard, and I can't just write him
a note and ask him to come and finish his resumé of Darwin
for me, without going over the boundaries; and the
worst of it is, it is <em>I</em> who set these limits;&mdash;I myself who
am a world too proud to say the first word or give the
slightest indication that his absence isn't quite as agreeable
as his presence."</p>

<p>"Well, Eva, I can write a note and request him to call and
see <em>me</em>," said Ida, "and if you like, I will. I have no sort of
fear what he will think of me."</p>

<p>"I would not have you for the world. It would look like
an advance on our part&mdash;no indeed. These creatures are
so conceited, if they once find out that you can't do without
them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never observed any signs of conceit in Mr. Henderson."</p>

<p>"Well, I have made it an object to keep him a little humble,
so far as his sex will permit, you see. But seriously,
Ida, is not it curious about this marriage matter? Everybody
says it's what we are made for, all the novels end
with it, all the poems are about it, you are hearing about it
in one way or other all the time; and yet all this while you
are supposed not to care anything about it one way or the
other. If a man be ever so agreeable to you, and do ever so
much to make you like him, you must pretend that you are
quite indifferent to him, and don't care whether he comes
or goes, until such time as he chooses to launch the tremendous
question at you."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ida, "I admit that there is just this absurdity
in our life: but I avoid it all by firmly laying
a plan of my own, and having a business of my own. To
me marriage would be an interruption; it would require a
breaking up and reconstruction of my whole plan, and of
course I really think nothing about it."</p>

<p>"But are you firmly resolved never to marry?"</p>

<p>"No; but never, unless I find some one more to me than
all on which I have set my heart. I do not need it for my
happiness. I am sufficient to myself; and besides I have an
object I hope to attain, and that is to open a way by which
many other women shall secure independence and comfort
and ease."</p>

<p>"Deary me, Ida, I wish I were like you: but I'm not.
It seems to me that the only way to give most girls any concentration
or object is to marry them. Then, somehow,
things seem to arrange themselves, and, at all events, the
world stops talking about you, and wondering what you
are going to do; they get you off their minds. That I do
believe was the reason why at one time I came so near
drifting into that affair with Wat Sydney. Aunt Maria
was so vigorous with me and talked in such a commanding
manner, and with so many 'of courses,' that I really began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
to think I was one of the 'of courses' myself; but my
acquaintance with Mr. Henderson has shown me that it
would be intolerable to live with a man that you couldn't
talk with about everything that comes into your head; and
now I can't talk with him, and I won't marry Wat Sydney;
and so what is to be done? Shall I go to Stewart's and
buy me a new suit of Willow Green, or gird up the loins
of my mind and go through Darwin like a man, and look
out all the terms in the dictionary and come out the other
side a strong minded female? or shall I go and join the
Sisters of St. John, and wear a great white cape and gray
gown, and have all the world say I did it because I
couldn't get Wat Sydney (for that's exactly what they
would say), or what shall I do? The trouble is, mamma
and Aunt Maria with their expectations. It's much as
mamma can do to survive <em>your</em> course, and if <em>I</em> take to
having a 'purpose' too, I don't know but mamma would
commit suicide, poor dear woman."</p>

<p>(Enter Alice with empressement):</p>

<p>"Girls, what do you think? Wat Sydney come back and
going to give a great croquet party out at Clairmont, and
of course we are all invited with notes in the most resplendent
style, with crest and coat of arms, and everything&mdash;perfectly
'<em>mag!</em>' There's to be a steamboat with a band
of music to take the guests up, and no end of splendid
doings; marquées and tents and illuminations and fireworks,
and to return by moonlight after all's over; isn't
it lovely? I do think Wat Sydney's perfectly splendid!
and it's all on your account, Eva, I know it is."</p>

<p>"Pooh, nonsense, you absurd child, I don't believe it. I
dare say its a party just to proclaim that he is engaged to
somebody else."</p>

<p>"Do you know," added Alice, "I met Jim Fellows, and
he says everybody is wild about this party&mdash;just stark,
tearing wild about it&mdash;for it isn't going to be a crush&mdash;something
<em>very</em> select."</p>

<p>"Is Jim going?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he showed me his ticket and Henderson's, and
he declared he was going to take 'Hal,' as he called him,
spite of his screams; he said that he had been writing and
studying and moping himself to death, and that he should
drag him out by the hair of the head. Come, Eva, let's go
down to Tullegig's and have a 'kank' about costumes. I
haven't a thing fit to wear, nor you either."</p>

<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_b.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Bolton's</span> letter excited in my mind a tumult of feeling.
From the beginning of my acquaintance I had
regarded him with daily increasing admiration.
Young men like a species of mental fealty&mdash;a friendship that
seems to draw them upward and give them an ideal of something
above themselves. Bolton's ripe, elegant scholarship,
his rare, critical taste, his calm insight into men and things,
and the depth of his moral judgment, had inspired me with
admiration, and his kindness for me with gratitude. It
had always been an additional source of interest that there
was something veiled about him&mdash;something that I could
not exactly make out. This letter, so dignified in its melancholy
frankness, seemed to let me into the secret of his
life. It showed me the reason of that sort of sad and weary
tolerance with which he seemed to regard life and its instincts,
so different from the fiery, forward-looking hope of
youth. He had impressed me from the first as one who
had made up his mind to endure all things and hope for
nothing. To keep watch every moment, to do the duty of
the hour thoroughly, bravely, faithfully, as a sentinel paces
through wind, rain and cold&mdash;neither asking why, nor uttering
complaints&mdash;such seemed to be Bolton's theory of life.</p>

<p>The infirmity which he laid open to my view was one,
to be sure, attributable in the first place to the thoughtless
wrong-doing of confident youth. Yet, in its beginning, how
little there was in it that looked like the deep and terrible
tragedy to which it was leading! Out of every ten young
men who begin the use of stimulants as a social exhilaration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
there are perhaps five in whose breast lies coiled up and
sleeping this serpent, destined in after years to be the deadly
tyrant of their life&mdash;this curse, unappeasable by tears or
prayers or agonies&mdash;with whom the struggle is like that of
Laocoön with the hideous Python. Yet songs and garlands
and poetry encircle the wine-cup, and ridicule and contumely
are reserved for him who fears to touch it.</p>

<p>There was about this letter such a patient dignity, such
an evident bracing of the whole man to meet in the bravest
manner the hard truth of the situation, and such a disinterested
care for others, as were to me inexpressibly touching.
I could not help feeling that he judged and sentenced
himself too severely, and that this was a case where a noble
woman might fitly co-work with a man, and by doubling
his nature give it double power of resistance and victory.</p>

<p>I went hastily up to his room with the letter in my hand
after reading it. It was in the dusk of the evening twilight,
but I could see him sitting there gazing out of the
window at the fading sky; yet it was too dark for either of
us to see the face of the other. There are some conversations
that can only be held in darkness&mdash;the visible presence
of the bodily form is an impediment&mdash;in darkness, spirit
speaks directly to spirit.</p>

<p>"Bolton," I said, "I am <em>yours</em> to every intent and purpose,
yours for life and death."</p>

<p>"And <em>after</em>," he said in a deep undertone, grasping
my hand. "I knew you would be, Harry."</p>

<p>"But, Bolton, you judge yourself too severely. Why
should you put from yourself the joys that other men, not
half so good as you, claim eagerly? If I were a woman like
Caroline, I can feel that I would rather share life with you,
in all your dangers and liabilities, than with many another."</p>

<p>He thought a moment, and then said slowly, "It is
well for Caroline that she has not this feeling; she probably
has by this time forgotten me, and I would not for the
world take the responsibility of trying to call back the
feeling she once had."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment my thoughts went back over many scenes,
and the real meaning of all Caroline's life came to me. I
appreciated the hardness of that lot of women which condemns
them to be tied to one spot and one course of employment,
when needing to fly from the atmosphere of an
unhappy experience. I thought of the blank stillness of
the little mountain town where her life had been passed,
of her restlessness add impatience, of that longing to fly to
new scenes and employments that she had expressed to me
on the eve of my starting for Europe; yet she had told
me her story, leaving out the one vital spot in it. I remembered
her saying that she had never seen the man with
whom she would think of marriage without a shudder.
Was it because she had forgotten? Or was it that woman
never even to herself admits that thought in connection
with one who seems to have forgotten her? Or had her
father so harshly painted the picture of her lover that she
had been led to believe him utterly vile and unprincipled?
Perhaps his proud silence had been interpreted by her as the
silence of indifference; perhaps she looked back on their
acquaintance with indignation that she should have been
employed merely to diversify the leisure of a rusticated
student and abandoned character. Whatever the experience
might be, Caroline had carried it through silently.</p>

<p>Her gay, indifferent, brilliant manner of treating any
approach to matters of the heart, as if they were the very
last subjects in which she could be supposed to have any
experience or interest, had been a complete blind to me,
nor could I, through this dazzling atmosphere, form the
least conjecture as to how the land actually lay.</p>

<p>In my former letters to her I had dwelt a good deal on
Bolton, and mentioned the little fact of finding her photograph
in his room. In reply, in a postscript at the end of
a letter about everything else, there was a brief notice.
"The Mr. Bolton you speak of taught the Academy in our
place while you were away at college&mdash;and of course I
was one of his scholars&mdash;but I have never seen or heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
him since. I was very young then, and it seems like something
in a preëxistent state to be reminded of him. I believed
him very clever, then, but was not old enough to
form much of an opinion." I thought of all this as I sat
silently in the dark with Bolton.</p>

<p>"Are you sure," I said, "that you consult for Caroline's
best happiness in doing as you have done?"</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and at last he said with a deep,
drawn breath,</p>

<p>"Yes. I am sure, the less I am to her the better."</p>

<p>"But may not your silence and apparent neglect and indifference
have given pain?"</p>

<p>"Probably; but they helped her to cease caring for me;
it was necessary that she should."</p>

<p>"Bolton, you are morbid in your estimate of yourself."</p>

<p>"You do not know all, Hal; nor what nor where I have
been. I have been swept far out to sea, plunged under
deep waters, all the waves and billows have been over me."</p>

<p>"Yet now, Bolton, surely you are on firm land. No man
is more established, more reliable, more useful."</p>

<p>"Yet," he said with a kind of shudder, "all this I might
lose in a moment. The other day when I dined with
Westerford, the good fellow had his wines in all frank
fellowship and pressed them on me, and the very smell
distracted me. I looked at the little glass in which he
poured some particularly fine sherry, and held to me to
taste, and thought it was like so much heart's blood. If I
had taken one taste, just one, I should have been utterly
worthless and unreliable for weeks. Yet Westerford could
not understand this; nobody can, except one who has been
through my bitter experience. One sip would flash to
the brain like fire, and then, all fear, all care, all conscience
would be gone, and not one glass, but a dozen would be
inevitable, and then you might have to look for me in some
of those dens to which the possessed of the devil flee when
the fit is on them, and where they rave and tear and cut
themselves with stones till the madness is worn out. This
has happened to me over and over, after long periods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
self-denial and self-control and illusive hope. It seems
to me that my experience is like that of a man whom
some cruel fiend condemns to go through all the agonies of
drowning over and over again&mdash;the dark plunge, the mad
struggle, the suffocation, the horror, the agony, the clutch
at the shore, the weary clamber up steep rocks, the sense
of relief, recovery, and hope, only to be wrenched off and
thrown back to struggle, and strangle, and sink again."</p>

<p>He spoke with such a deep intensity of voice that I drew
in my breath, and a silence as of the grave fell between us.</p>

<p>"Harry," he said, after a pause, "you know we read in the
Greek tragedies of men and women whom the gods have
smitten with unnatural and guilty purposes. In which they
were irresistibly impelled toward what they abominated
and shuddered at! Is it not strange that the Greek fable
should have a real counterpart in the midst of our modern
life? That young man in all the inexperience and
thoughtlessness of youth should be beguiled into just such
a fatality; that there should be a possibility that they
could be blighted by just such a doom, and yet that song,
and poetry, and social illusion, and society customs should
all be thrown around courses which excite and develop
this fatality! What opera is complete without its drinking
chorus? I remember when it used to be my forte to sing
drinking songs; so the world goes! Men triumph and
rejoice going to a doom to which death is a trifle. If I had
fallen dead, the first glass of wine I tasted, it would have
been thought a horrible thing; but it would have been
better for my mother, better for me, than to have lived as I
did."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Bolton! don't say so: you become morbid in
dwelling on this subject."</p>

<p>"No, Hal. I only know more of it than you. This curse
has made life an unspeakable burden, a doom instead of a
privilege. It has disappointed my friends, and subjected me
to humiliations and agonies such that death seems to me a
refuge; and yet it was all in its beginning mere thoughtlessness
and ignorance. I was lost before I knew it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you are not lost, and you shall not be!" I exclaimed,
"you are good for more than most men now, and you will
come through this."</p>

<p>"Never! to be just as others are. I shall be a vessel
with a crack in it, always."</p>

<p>"Well, a vase of fine porcelain with a crack in it is better
than earthenware without," I said.</p>

<p>"If I had not disappointed myself and my friends so
often," said Bolton, "I might look on myself as sound and
sane. But the mere sight and smell of the wine at Westerford's
dinner gave me a giddy sensation that alarmed me;
it showed that I was not yet out of danger, and it made me
resolve to strengthen my self by making you my keeper.
You have the advantage of perfectly healthy nerves that
have come to manhood without the strain of any false stimulus,
and you can be strong for both of us."</p>

<p>"God grant it!" said I, earnestly.</p>

<p>"But I warn you that, if the curse comes upon me you are
not to trust me. I am a Christian and a man of honor in my
sane moments, but let me tell you one glass of wine would
make me a liar on this subject. I should lie, and intrigue,
and deceive the very elect, to get at the miserable completion
of the aroused fury, and there are times when I am
so excited that I fear I may take that first irrevocable step;
it is a horror, a nightmare, a temptation of the devil,&mdash;for
that there is a devil, men with my experience know; but
there is a kind of safety in having a friend of a steady
pulse with me who knows all. The mere fact that you
do know helps hold me firm."</p>

<p>"Bolton," said I, "the situation you offer to Caroline
in the care of the <cite>Ladies' Cabinet</cite> will of course oblige
her to come to New York. Shall you meet her and renew
your acquaintance?"</p>

<p>"I do not desire to," he said.</p>

<p>There was a slight hesitancy and faltering of his voice
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yet it can hardly be possible that you will not meet;
you will have arrangements to make with her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is one of the uses, among others, of having
you. All that relates to her affairs will pass through you;
and now, let us talk of the magazine and its programme
for the season. What is the reason, Hal, that you waste
your forces in short sketches? Why do you not boldly dash
out into a serial story? Come, now, I am resolved among
other things on a serial story by Harry Henderson."</p>

<p>"And I will recommend a taking title," cried Jim Fellows,
who came in as we were talking, and stood behind my
chair. "Let us have</p>

<p class="center">
<em><span class="gesperrt">HENDERSON'S HORROR</span>; or, The Mystery
of the Bloody Latch-Key.</em><br />
</p>

<p><em>There's</em> a title to take with the reflecting public! The
readers of serials are generally girls from twelve to twenty,
and they read them with their back-hair down, lounging on
the bed, just before a nap after dinner, and there must be
enough blood and thunder, and murder and adultery and
mystery in them to keep the dear creatures reading at least
half an hour."</p>

<p>"I think serial stories are about played out in our day,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. There's sister Nell, don't read anything
else. She is regularly running on five serial stories, and
among them all they keep her nicely a-going; and she tells
me that the case is the same with all the girls in her set.
The knowledge of the world and of human nature that the
pretty creatures get in this way is something quite astounding.
Nell is at present deeply interested in a fair lady who
connives with her chambermaid to pass off her illegitimate
child upon her husband as his own; and we have lying and
false swearing, I say nothing of all other kinds of interesting
things on every page. Of course this is written as a
moral lesson, and interspersed with pious reflections to
teach girls as how they hadn't oughter do so and so. All
this, you see, has a refining effect upon the rising generation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, really, Bolton, don't you think that it is treating
our modern society as children, to fall in with this extreme
fashion of story-telling? It seems so childish to need pictures
and stories for everything. Isn't your magazine
strong enough to lead and form public taste instead of
following it?"</p>

<p>"Well, if I owned my magazine I would try it," said Bolton.
"But, you see, the Westerfords, while they give me
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i> as to means to run it, expect of course that it
is to be run in the approved popular grooves that the dear
thoughtless ten million prefer. The people who lounge on
beds after dinner are our audience, and there must be nothing
wiser nor stronger than they can apprehend between
sleeping and waking. We talk to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i>, hurried, unreflecting,
indolent generation, who want emotion and don't
care for reason. Something sharp and spicy, something
pungent and stinging&mdash;no matter what or whence. And
now as they want this sort of thing, why not give it to
them? Are there no other condiments for seasoning stories
besides intrigues, lies, murders, and adulteries? And
if the young and unreflecting will read stories shouldn't
some of the thoughtful and reflecting make stories for
them to read?"</p>

<p>"Of course they should, Q. E. D.," said Jim Fellows,
touching the gas with a match, and sending a flare of light
upon our conference. "But come, now, behold the last novelty
of the season," said he, tossing two cards of invitation.
"This is for us, as sons of the press and recording angels,
to be present at Wat Sydney's grand blow-out next Tuesday.
All the rank and fashion are to go. It is to be very
select, and there are people who would give their eye-teeth
for these cards, and can't get 'em. How do ye say, Old Man
of the Mountain, will you go?"</p>

<p>"No," said Bolton; "not my line."</p>

<p>"Well, at all events, Hal has got to go. I promised the
fair Alice that I'd bring him if I had to take him by the
hair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>I had a great mind to decline. I thought in my heart it
was not at all the wisest thing for me to go; but then,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Amare et sapere vix Deo</i>&mdash;I had never seen Sydney, and I
had a restless desire to see him and Eva together&mdash;and I
thought of forty good reasons why I should go.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE GAME OF CROQUET.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_n.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Now</span> I advise all serious, sensible individuals who
never intend to do anything that is not exactly most
reasonable and most prudent, and who always do
exactly as they intend, not to follow my steps on the
present occasion, for I am going to do exactly what is <em>not</em>
to be recommended to young gentlemen in my situation,
and certainly what is not at all prudent.</p>

<p>For if a young man finds himself without recall, hopelessly
in love with one whose smiles are all for another,
his best way is to keep out of her society, and in a course
of engrossing business that will leave him as little time
to think of her as possible.</p>

<p>I had every advantage for pursuing this course, for I had
a press of writing upon me, finishing up a batch of literary
job-work which I wished to get fairly out of the way so that
I might give my whole energies to Bolton in our new enterprise.
In fact, to go off philandering to a croquet party up
the North River was a sheer piece of childish folly, and
the only earthly reason I could really give for it was the
presence of a woman there that I had resolved to avoid.
In fact I felt that the thing was so altogether silly that
I pretended to myself that I was impregnably resolved
against it, and sat myself down in Bolton's room making
abstracts from some of his books, knowing all the while
that Jim would seek me out there and have his moral
fish-hook fast in my coat collar, as in truth he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, come, Hal," he said, bursting in, "I promised the
divinest of her sex to bring you along."</p>

<p>"Oh nonsense, Jim! it's out of the question," said I. "I've
got to get this article done."</p>

<p>"Oh, you be hanged with your article, come along!
What's the use of a fellow's shutting himself up with
books? I tell you, Hal, if you're going to write for <em>folks</em>
you must <em>see</em> folks and folks must see you, and you must
be around and into and a part of all that's going on. Come
on! Why, you don't know the honor done you. Its a
tip-top select party, and all the handsomest girls and all
the nobby fellows will be there, and no end of fun. Sydney's
place alone is worth going to see. Its the crack
place on the river; and then they say the engagement is
going to be declared, and everybody is wild to know
whether it is or isn't to be, and the girls are furbishing
up fancy suits to croquet in. Miss Alice treated me to
a glimpse of hers as I met her on Tullegig's steps, and
its calculated to drive a fellow crazy, and so <em>come now</em>,"
said Jim, pulling away my papers and laying hold of me,
"let's go out and get some gloves and proceed to make
ourselves up. We have the press to represent, and we
must be nobby, so hang expense! here's for Jouvin's best,
and let to-morrow take care of itself."</p>

<p>Now, seconding all these temptations was that perverse
inclination that makes every man want to see a little
more and taste a little more of what he has had too
much already. Moreover I wanted to see Eva and Wat
Sydney together. I wanted to be certain and satisfy myself
with my own eyes, not only that they were engaged
but that she was in love with him. If she be, said I to
myself, she is certainly an exquisite coquette and a dangerous
woman for me to keep up an acquaintance with.</p>

<p>In thinking over as I had done since Mrs. Van Arsdel's
motherly conversation, all our intercourse and acquaintance
with each other, her conduct sometimes seemed to
me to be that of a veritable "Lady Clara Vere de Vere,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
bent on amusing herself, and diversifying the tedium of
fashionable life by exciting feelings which she had no
thought of returning. When I took this view of matters
I felt angry and contemptuous and resolved to show the
fair lady that I could be as indifferent as she. Sometimes
I made myself supremely wretched by supposing
that it was by her desire that Mrs. Van Arsdel had held
the conversation with me, and that it was a sort of intimation
that she had perceived my feelings, and resolved
to put a decided check upon them. But of course nothing
so straightforward and sensible as going to her for
an explanation of all this was to be thought of. In fact
our intercourse with one another ever since the memorable
occasion I refer to had been daily lessening, and
now was generally limited to passing the most ordinary
common-places with each other. She had grown cold and
dry, almost haughty, and I was conscious of a most unnatural
rigidity and constraint. It seemed to me sometimes
astonishing when I looked back a little, to reflect
how perfectly easy and free and unconstrained we always
had been up to a certain point, to find that now we met
with so little enjoyment, talked and said so little to any
purpose. It was as if some evil enchanter had touched
us with his wand stiffening every nerve of pleasure. To
look forward to meeting her in society was no longer, as
it had been, to look forward to delightful hours; and yet
for the life of me I could not help going where this most
unsatisfactory, tantalizing intercourse was all I had to hope
for.</p>

<p>But to-day, I said to myself, I would grasp the thorns
of the situation so firmly as to break them down and
take a firm hold on reality. If, indeed, her engagement
were to-day to be declared, I would face the music like
a man, walk up to her and present my congratulations in
due form, and then the acquaintance would make a gallant
finale in the glare of wedding lamps and the fanfaronade
of wedding festivities, and away to fresh fields and pastures
new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, whatever a man is secretly inclined to do there
are always a hundred sensible incontrovertible reasons to
be found for doing, and so I found myself one of the
gay and festive throng on board the steamer. A party
of well-dressed people floating up the North River of a
bright Spring day is about as ideal a picture of travel as
can be desired. In point of natural scenery the Rhine is
nothing compared with the Hudson, and our American
steamboats certainly are as far ahead of any that ever
appeared on the Rhine as Aladdin's palace is ahead of an
ordinary dwelling. The most superb boat on the river had
been retained for the occasion, and a band of music added
liveliness to the scene as we moved off from the wharf
in triumph, as gay, glittering, festive a company as heart
could wish.</p>

<p>Wat Sydney as host and entertainer was everywhere
present, making himself agreeable by the most devoted
attentions to the comfort of the bright band of tropical
birds, fluttering in silks and feathers and ribbons, whom
he had charge of for the day. I was presented to him
by Jim Fellows, and had an opportunity to see that apart
from his immense wealth he had no very striking personal
points to distinguish him from a hundred other young men
about him. His dress was scrupulously adjusted, with a
care and nicety which showed that he was by no means
without consideration of the personal impression he made.
Every article was the choicest and best that the most orthodox
fashionable emporiums pronounced the latest thing,
or as Jim Fellows phrased it, decidedly "nobby." He was
of a medium height, with very light hair and eyes, and
the thin complexion which usually attends that style, and
which, under the kind of exposure incident to a man's
life, generally tends to too much redness of face.</p>

<p>Altogether, my first running commentary on the man
as I shook hands with him was, that if Eva were in love
with him it was not for his beauty; yet I could see glances
falling on him on all sides from undeniably handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
eyes that would have excused any man for having a favorable
conceit of his own personal presence.</p>

<p>Mr. Sydney was well accustomed to being the cynosure
of female eyes, and walked the deck with the assured
step of a man certain of pleasing. A rich good-humored
young man who manifests himself daily in splendid turn-outs,
who rains down flowers and confectionery among
his feminine acquaintances, and sends diamonds and pearls
as philop&oelig;na presents, certainly does not need a romantic
style of beauty or any particular degree of mental culture
to make his society more than acceptable. Prudent mammas
were generally of opinion that the height of felicity
for a daughter would be the position that should enable
her to be the mistress and dictatrix of his ample fortune.
Mr. Sydney was perfectly well aware of this state of things.
He was a man a little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i> with the kind attentions of
matrons, and tolerably secure of the good-will of very
charming young ladies. He had the prestige of success,
and had generally carried his points in the world of men
and things. Miss Eva Van Arsdel had been the first young
lady who had given him the novel sensation of a repulse,
and thenceforth became an object of absorbing interest
in his eyes. Under the careless good-humor of his general
appearance Sydney had a constitutional pertinacity, a
persistence in his own way that had been a source of many
of his brilliant successes in business. He was one of those
whom obstacles and difficulties only stimulate, and whose
tenacity of purpose increases with resistance. He was
cautious, sagacious, ready to wait and watch and renew
the attack at intervals, but never to give up. To succeed
was a tribute to his own self-esteem, and whatever was
difficult of attainment was the more valuable.</p>

<p>A little observation during the course of the first hour
convinced me that there was as yet no announcement of
an engagement. Mrs. Van Arsdel and Aunt Maria Wouvermans,
to be sure, were on most balmy and confidential
terms with Mr. Sydney, addressing him with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
appearance of mysterious intimacy, and quite willing to produce
the impression that the whole fête was in some
manner a tribute to the family, but these appearances
were not carried out by any coöperative movements on
the part of Eva herself. She appeared radiant in a fanciful
blue croquet suit which threw out to advantage the
golden shade of her hair, and the pink sea-shell delicacy
of her cheek, and as usual she had her court around her
and was managing her circle with the address of a practiced
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habituée</i> of society.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Favors to none, to all, she smiles extends,</div>
      <div class="verse">Oft she rejects, but never once offends.</div>
      <div class="verse">Bright as the sun, her beams the gazers strike,</div>
      <div class="verse">And like the sun, they smile on all alike."</div>
	</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Unlike many of her sex, Eva had the faculty of carrying
the full cup of bellehood without spilling an unseemly drop,
and as she was one of those who seem to have quite as
much gift in charming her feminine as her masculine acquaintances,
she generally sat surrounded by an admiring
body-guard of girls who laughed at her jests and echoed
her bon mots and kept up a sort of radiant atmosphere
of life and motion and gayety around her. Her constitutional
good-nature, her readiness to admire other people,
and to help each in due season to some small portion of
the applause and admiration which is lying about loose
for general circulation in society, all contributed to her
popularity. As I approached the circle they were discussing
with great animation the preliminaries of a match
game of croquet that was proposed to be played at Clairmont
to-day.</p>

<p>"Oh, here comes Mr. Henderson! let's ask him," she said,
as I approached the circle.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it will be a nice thing?" she said.
"Mr. Sydney has arranged that after playing the first
games as a trial the four best players shall be elected to
play a match game, two on each side."</p>

<p>"I think it will vary the usual monotony of croquet,"
said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hear him," she said, gaily, "talk of the usual monotony
of croquet! For my part I think there is a constant variety
to it, no two games are ever alike."</p>

<p>"To me," I said, "it seems that after a certain amount
of practice the result is likely to be the same thing, game
after game."</p>

<p>"Girls," she said, "I perceive that Mr. Henderson is used
to carrying all before him. He is probably a champion
player who will walk through all the wickets as a matter
of course."</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said. "On the contrary I shouldn't wonder
if I should 'booby' hopelessly at the very first wicket."</p>

<p>"And none the worse for that," said Sydney. "I've
boobied three times running, in the first of a game, and
yet beaten; it gets one's blood up, and one <em>will</em> beat."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Miss Alice, "the more my blood is
up the less I can do; if I get excited I lose my aim, my
hand trembles, and I miss the very simplest move."</p>

<p>"I think there is nothing varies so much as one's luck
in croquet," said Eva. "Sometimes for weeks together I
am sure to hit every aim and to carry every wicket, and
then all of a sudden, without rhyme or reason, I make
the most absurd failures, and generally when I pique myself
on success."</p>

<p>"I think, Miss Eva, I remember you as the best player in
Newport last Summer," said Mr. Sydney.</p>

<p>"And likely as not I shall fail ingloriously to-day,"
said she.</p>

<p>"Well, we shall all have a time for bringing our hands
in," said Mr. Sydney. "I have arranged four croquet
grounds, and the fifth one is laid out for the trial game
with longer intervals and special difficulties in the arrangement,
to make it as exciting as possible. The victorious
side is to have a prize."</p>

<p>"Oh, how splendid! What is the prize to be? was the
general exclamation."</p>

<p>"Behold, then!" said Mr. Sydney, drawing from his pocket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
a velvet case which when opened displayed a tiny croquet
mallet wrought in gold and set as a lady's pin. Depending
from it by four gold chains were four little balls of
emerald, ruby, amethyst, and topaz.</p>

<p>"How perfectly lovely! how divine! how beautiful!"
were the sounds that arose from the brilliant little circle
that were in a moment precipitated upon the treasure.</p>

<p>"You will really set them all by the ears, Mr. Sydney,"
said Mrs. Van Arsdel. "Croquet of itself is exciting
enough; one is apt to lose one's temper."</p>

<p>"You ought to see mamma and Mrs. Van Duzen and Aunt
Maria play," said Eva, "if you want to see an edifying
game, it's too funny. They are all so polite and so dreadfully
courtly and grieved to do anything disagreeable to
each other, and you know croquet is such a perfectly
selfish, savage, unchristian game; so when poor Mrs. Van
Duzen is told that she ought to croquet mamma's ball
away from the wicket, the dear lady, is quite ready to
cry and declares that it would be such a pity to disappoint
her, that she croquets her through her wicket, and
looks round apologizing for her virtues with such a pitiful
face! 'Indeed, my dear, I couldn't help it!'"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, "I really think it is too
bad when a poor body has been battering and laboring
at a difficult wicket to be croqueted back a dozen times."</p>

<p>"It's meant for the culture of Christian patience, mamma,"
said Eva. "Croquet is the game of life, you see."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mr. Sydney, rubbing his hands, "and
it teaches you just how to manage, use your friends to
help yourself along, and then croquet them into good
positions; use your enemies as long as you want them,
and then send them to&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"The devil," said Jim Fellows, who never hesitated to
fill up an emphatic blank in the conversation.</p>

<p>"I didn't say that," said Mr. Sydney.</p>

<p>"But you meant it, all the same; and that's the long
and the short of the philosophy of the game of life,"
said Jim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>"And" said I, "one may read all sorts of life-histories
in the game. Some go on with a steady aim and true
stroke, and make wickets, and hit balls, yet are croqueted
back ingloriously or hopelessly wired and lose the game,
while others blunder advantageously and are croqueted
along by skillful partners into all the best places."</p>

<p>"There are few of us girls that make our own wickets
in life," said Eva. "We are all croqueted along by papas
and mammas."</p>

<p>"And many a man is croqueted along by a smart
wife," said Sydney.</p>

<p>"But more women by smart husbands," said Mrs. Van
Arsdel.</p>

<p>On that there was a general exclamation, and the conversation
forthwith whisked into one of those animated
whirlwinds that always arise when the comparative merits
of the sexes are moved. There was a flutter of ribbons
and a rustle of fans and a laughing cross-fire of sharp
sayings, till the whole was broken up by the announcement
that we were drawing near the landing.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE MATCH GAME.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> lawn at Clairmont made a brilliant spectacle, all
laid out with different croquet sets. The turf was
like velvet, and adjoining every ground was a pretty
tent, with seats and every commodious provision for repairing
at once any temporary derangement of the feminine toilet.
The fluttering of gay flags and pennons from these various
tents gave an airy and breezy look to the scene, and immediately
we formed ourselves into sets, and the games began.
It had been arranged that the preliminary playing should
take place immediately, and the match game be reserved
till after lunch. The various fancy costumes of the players,
lit up by the bright sunshine, and contrasted with the
emerald green of the lawn, formed a brilliant and animated
picture, watched with interest by groups of non-combatants
from rustic seats under the trees. Of course everybody was
a little nervous in the trial games, and there was the usual
amount of ill luck, and of "Ohs and Ahs" of success or
failure. I made myself a "booby" twice, in that unaccountable
way that seems like fatality. Then suddenly, favored
of the fates, made two wickets at once, seized an antagonist's
ball, and went with it at one heat through the side
wicket, the middle and other side wicket up to the stake and
down again, through the middle wicket to the stake again,
and then struck back a glorious rover to join my partner.
It was one of those prodigiously lucky runs, when one's ball
goes exactly where it is intended, and stops exactly in the
right place, and though it was mostly owing to good luck,
with the usual prestige of success I was covered with glory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
and congratulations, and my partner, Miss Sophie Elmore,
herself a champion at croquet, was pleased to express most
unbounded admiration, especially as our side came out
decidedly victorious.</p>

<p>Miss Sophie, a neat little vigorous brunette, in a ravishing
fancy croquet-suit, entered into the game with all that
whole-hearted ardor which makes women such terrible
combatants.</p>

<p>"Oh, I <em>do</em> hope that we shall be in at that final match-game!"
she said, with a charming abandon of manner. "I
should so like to beat Eva Van Arsdel. Those Van Arsdels
always expect to carry all before them, and it rather provokes
me, I confess. Now, with you to help me, Mr. Henderson,
I am sure we could beat."</p>

<p>"Don't put too much faith in my accidental run of luck,"
I said; "'one swallow does not make a summer.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm quite sure by the way you managed your game
that it wasn't luck. But you see I want to try with Eva Van
Arsdel again, for she and I were held to be the best players
at Newport last summer, and she beat in the last 'rubber'
we played. It was so provoking&mdash;just one slip of the mallet
that ruined me! You know, sometimes, how your mallet
will turn in your hands. She made just such a slip and took
the stroke over again. Now that is what I never will do,
you see," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>In short, I could see that for pretty Miss Sophie, at present,
croquet was to all intents and purposes, the whole game of
life, that every spangle and every hair-pin about her were
vital with excitement to win.</p>

<p>After lunch came the ballot for the combatants who were
to play the deciding game, and the parties elected were:
Miss Sophie Elmore, Miss Eva Van Arsdel, Mr. Sydney, and
myself.</p>

<p>"Miss Van Arsdel," said Mr. Sydney, "you must be my
captain. After the feats that you and Mr. Henderson have
been performing it would be impossible to allow you both
on one side."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think just as likely as not you will be worsted for your
pains," said Eva. "I know Sophie of old for a terrible
antagonist, and when she pulls on her croquet-gloves like
that, it means war to the knife, and no quarter. So, my
dear, begin the tournament."</p>

<p>The wickets were arranged at extra distances upon this
trial ground, and it was hardly prudent to attempt making
two wickets at once, but Miss Sophie played in the adventurous
style, and sent her ball with a vigorous tap not only
through both the first wickets, but so far ahead that it was
entangled in the wires of the middle wicket, in a way that
made it impossible to give it a fair stroke.</p>

<p>"Now, how vexatious!" she cried.</p>

<p>"I have two extra strokes for my two wickets, but I shall
make nothing by it." In fact, Miss Sophie, with two nervous
hits, succeeded only in placing her ball exactly where with
fair luck the next player must be sure to get it.</p>

<p>Eva now came through the two first wickets, one at a time,
and with a well-directed tap took possession of Miss Sophie,
who groaned audibly, "Oh, now she's got me! well, there's
no saying now where she'll stop."</p>

<p>In fact, Miss Eva performed very skillfully the rôle of the
"cat who doth play, and after&mdash;slay." She was perfect
mistress of the tactics of split-shots, which sent her antagonist's
ball one side the wicket and hers the other, and all
the other mysteries of the craft, and she used them well,
till she had been up and hit the stake and come down to
the middle wicket, when her luck failed.</p>

<p>Then came my turn, and I came through the first two
wickets, struck her ball and used it for the two next wickets,
till I came near my partner, when with a prosperous
split-shot I sent her off to distant regions, struck my partner's
ball, put it through its wicket, and came and stationed
myself within its reach for future use.</p>

<p>Then came Mr. Sydney with a vigorous succession of hits,
and knocked us apart; sent one to one side of the ground,
and one to the other, and went gallantly up to his partner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
By this time our blood was thoroughly up, and the game
became as Eva prophesied, "war to the knife." Mohawk indians
could not have been more merciless in purposes of
utter mischief to each other than we, and for a while it
seemed as if nothing was done but to attack each other's
balls, and send them as far as possible to the uttermost part
of the grounds. As each had about equal skill in making
long shots the re-union however was constantly effected,
and thus each in turn were beaten back from the wickets, till
it seemed for a while that the game would make no
progress.</p>

<p>At last, however, one slip of our antagonists threw the
power into our hands, and Miss Sophie used it to take herself
and me up through three wickets to the stake, and
thence down again till the intricate middle wicket stopped
our course.</p>

<p>A burst of cheering greeted her success, and the dark little
lady seemed to glow like a coal of fire. I wasn't sure that
sparks did not snap from her eyes as she ended her performance
with a croquet that sent Eva's ball spinning to the
most inaccessible distances.</p>

<p>A well-pointed shot from Wat Sydney again turned the
tide of battle, and routed the victors, while he went to the
rescue of the banished princess, and took her back to
position.</p>

<p>Every turn of the tide, and every good shot was hailed
with cheers, and the excitement became intense. There
were points in the battle as hard to carry as the Malakoff,
and we did nothing but fight, without advancing
a step. It seemed for a while that none of us would
ever so far get the advantage of another as to pass that
downward middle wicket. Every successive step was
won by battles. The ladies were so excited that they
seemed two flames of fire. Every nerve in them was
alive, and we men felt ourselves only clumsy instruments
of their enkindled ardor. We were ordered about, commanded,
rebuked, encouraged, and cheered on to the fray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
with a pungency and vigor of decision that made us
quite secondary characters in the scene. At last a fortunate
stroke gave Miss Sophie the command of the game,
and she dashed through the middle wicket, sent Eva's
ball to farthest regions up, and Mr. Sydney's down to
the stake, took mine with her in her victorious race
through wicket after wicket, quite through to the stake,
and then leaving me for a moment she croqueted Sydney's
ball against the stake, and put it out. A general
cheer and shouts of "victory" arose.</p>

<p>"We've got it! We're quite sure to go out the next
move!" she said, in triumph, as she left her ball by my
side. "She never can hit at that distance."</p>

<p>"I can try, though," said Eva, walking across the ground,
and taking her place by her ball, pale and resolved, with a
concentrated calmness. She sighted the balls deliberately,
poised her mallet, took aim, and gave a well-considered
stroke. Like a straight-aimed arrow the ball flew across
the green, through the final wicket, and struck Sophie's
ball!</p>

<p>A general cheering arose, and the victorious markswoman
walked deliberately down to finish her work. One
stroke put Sophie out of the combat, the next struck
upon me and then from me up to the head of the two
last wickets that yet remained to be made. She came
through these with one straight stroke, and hit me again.</p>

<p>"Now for it," she said, setting her red-slippered foot firmly
on the ball, and with one virulent tap, away flew my ball
to the other end of the ground, while at the same time
hers hit the stake and the victory was won.</p>

<p>A general shout, and three cheers, and all the spectators
started from their seats like a troop of gay tropical birds,
and came flocking around the victors.</p>

<p>I knelt down, and laid my mallet at her feet. "Beautiful
princess!" said I, "behold your enemies, conquered,
await your sentence."</p>

<p>"Arise, Sir Knight," she said, laughing; "I sentence you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
to write a ballad describing this battle. Come, Sophie,"
she added, turning gayly to the brunette, "let's shake
hands on it. You shall have your revenge of me at
Newport this summer," and the two rival fair ones shook
hands in all apparent amity.</p>

<p>Wat Sydney now advancing presented the prize with a
gallant bow, and Eva accepted it graciously, and fastened
the blue scarf that floated over her shoulder with it, and
then the whole party adjourned to another portion of the
lawn, which had been arranged for dancing; the music
struck up and soon we were all joining in the dance with
a general hilarity.</p>

<p>And so ended the day at Clairmont, and we came home
under a broad full moon, to the sound of music on the
waters.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My dearest Belle</span>:&mdash;Since I last wrote you wondrous
things have taken place, and of course I
must keep you <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au courant</i>.</p>

<p>In the first place Mr. Sydney came back to our horizon
like a comet in a blaze of glory. The first harbinger of
his return was not himself in propriâ, but <em>cards</em> for a
croquet fête up at Clairmont got up with the last degree
of elegance.</p>

<p>Mr. Sydney, it appears, understands the effect of a
gilded frame to set off a picture, and so resolved to manifest
himself to us in all his surroundings at Clairmont.</p>

<p>The party was to be very select and recherché, and of
course everybody was just wild to go, and the Elmores
in particular were on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i> to know if we had
invitations before them. Sophia Elmore called down for
nothing but to see. We had all the satisfaction there
was to be got in showing her our cards and letting her
know that they had come two days sooner than theirs.
Aunt Maria contrived to give them to understand that
Mr. Sydney gave the entertainment mostly on my account,
which I think was assuming quite too much in the case.
I am positively tired of these mean little rivalries and
these races that are run between families.</p>

<p>It is thought that Sophia Elmore is quite fascinated by
Mr. Sydney. Sophia is a nice, spirited girl, with a good,
generous heart as I believe, and it's a thousand pities she
shouldn't have him if she cares for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>But, to my story. You may imagine the fuss at Tullegig's.
Of course we belong to the class who live in the
enjoyment of "nothing to wear," and the first result of a
projected entertainment is to throw us all on our knees
before Tullegig, who queens it over us accordingly.</p>

<p>I was just dying to find out if <em>a certain person</em> was to
be there. Of late our intercourse has been so very stately
and diplomatic that it really becomes exciting. He has
avoided every appearance of intimacy, every approach to
our old confidential standing, and yet apparently for the
life of him cannot keep from taking views of me at safe
distance; so, as I said, it was something to see if he
would be there.</p>

<p>As to Clairmont, I think in the course of my life I
have seen fine grounds, fine houses, fine furniture, and
fine fêtes before. Nevertheless I must do Sydney the
justice to say that he gave a most charming and beautiful
entertainment where everything was just as lovely
as could be. We went up on a splendid boat to the sound
of music. We had a magnificent lunch under the trees,
and there were arrangements for four games to go on at
once, which made a gay and animated tableau. All the
girls wore the prettiest costumes you can imagine, each
one seeming prettier than the other; and when they were
all moving about in the game it made a bright, cheerful
effect. Mr. Henderson was there and distinguished
himself to such a degree that he was appointed one of
the four who were to play a match-game, in conclusion,
for a prize. Curiously enough he played with Sophia
against Sydney and myself. How we did fight! Sophie
is one of these girls that feel everything to the tips of their
fingers, and I am another, and if we didn't make those men
bestir themselves! I fancy they found women rulers were
of a kind to keep men pretty busy.</p>

<p>I can imagine the excitement we women would make of
an election if we should ever get into politics. Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
we not croquet our adversaries' balls, and make stunning
split-shots in parties, and wire ourselves artfully behind
wickets, and do all sorts of perplexing things? I confess
if the excitement should get to be half as great as in
playing croquet, I should tremble to think of it.</p>

<p>Well, it was some excitement at all events to play against
each other, he and I. Didn't I seek out his ball, didn't I
pursue it, beat it back from wickets, come on it with most
surprising and unexpected shots? Sophie fought with desperation
on the other side, and at last they seemed to have
carried the day, there was but one stroke wanting to put
them out; they had killed Sydney at the stake and banished
me to the farthest extremity of the ground. Mamma always
said I had the genius for emergencies, and if you'll
believe me I struck quite across the ground and hit Sophie's
ball and sent it out, and then I took <em>his</em> back to make
my two last wickets with, and finally with an imposing
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de théâtre</i> I croqueted him to the other end of the
ground, and went out amid thunders of applause. He
took it with great presence of mind, knelt down and laid
the mallet handsomely at my feet, and professed to deliver
himself captive, and I imposed it on him as a task to write
a ballad descriptive of the encounter. So he was shut up
for about half an hour in the library, and came out with a
very fine and funny ballad in Chevy Chase measure describing
our exploits, which was read under the trees, and
cheered and encored in the liveliest manner possible.</p>

<p>On the whole, Mr. Henderson may be said to have had
quite a society success yesterday, as I heard him very much
admired, and the Elmores overwhelmed him with pressing
invitations to call, to come to their soirées, etc., etc. You
see these Elmores have everything money can buy, and so
they are distracted to be literary, or at least to have literary
people in their train, and they have always been wanting
to get Henderson and Jim Fellows to their receptions. So
I heard Mrs. Elmore overwhelming him with compliments
on his poem in a way that quite amused me, for I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
enough of him to know exactly how all this seemed to him.
He is of all persons one of the most difficult to flatter, and
has the keenest sense of the ridiculous; and Mrs. Elmore's
style is as if one should empty a bushel basket of peaches
or grapes on your head instead of passing the fruit dish.</p>

<p>But I am so busy traducing my neighbors that I forgot to
say I won the croquet prize, which was duly presented. It
was a gold croquet mallet set as a pin with four balls of
emerald, amethyst, ruby, and topaz depending from it. It
had quite an Etruscan effect and was very pretty, but when
I saw how much Sophia really took the defeat to heart,
my soul was moved for her and I made a peace-offering
by getting her to accept it. It was not easy at first, but I
made a point of it and insisted upon it with all my logic,
telling her that in point of skill she had really won the
game, that my last stroke was only a lucky accident, and
you know I can generally talk people into almost anything
I set my heart on, and so as Sophie was flattered by
my estimate of her skill and as the bauble is a pretty one,
I prevailed on her to take it. I am tired and sick of this fuss
between the Elmores and us, and don't mean to have more
of it, for Sophie really is a nice girl, and not a bit more
spoiled than any of the rest of us, notwithstanding all the
nonsense of her family, and she and I have agreed to be fast
friends for the future, whatever may come.</p>

<p>I had one other motive in this move. I never have accepted
jewelry from Sydney, and I was quite willing to
be rid of this. If I could only croquet his heart down to
Sophie to use, it might be a nice thing. I fancy she would
like it.</p>

<p>I managed my cards quite adroitly all day to avoid a
tête-à-tête interview with Sydney. I was careful always to
be in the center of a group of two or three, and when he
asked me to walk through the conservatories with him I
said, "Come, Amy and Jane," and took them along.</p>

<p>As to <em>somebody</em> else, <em>he</em> made no attempt of the kind,
though I could see that he <em>saw</em> me wherever I went. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
these creatures suppose we don't see their eyes, and fancy
that they conceal their feelings? I am perfectly certain
that whatever the matter is, he thinks as much of me as
ever he did.</p>

<p>Well, it was moonlight and music all the way home, the
band playing the most heart-breaking, entrancing harmonies
from Beethoven and melodies from Schubert, and then
Wat Sydney annoyed me beyond measure by keeping up a
distracting chit-chat when I wanted to be quiet and listen.
He cares nothing for music, and people who don't are like
flies, they have no mercy and never will leave you a quiet
moment. The <em>other one</em> went off and sat by himself, gazed
at the moon and heard the music all in the most proper
and romantic style, and looked like a handsome tenor at an
opera.</p>

<hr class="tbmt2" />

<p class="mt2">So far, my dear, the history of our affairs. But something
more surprising than ever you heard has just happened,
and I must hasten to jot it down.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, being worried and wearied with the
day before, I left your letter, as you see, and teased Ida to
go out driving with me in the Park. She had promised
Effie St. Clere to sketch some patterns of arbors and garden
seats that are there, for her new place at Fern Valley, and I
had resolved on a lonely ramble to clear my heart and brain.</p>

<p>Moreover, the last time I was there I saw from one of the
bridges a very pretty cascade falling into a charming little
wooded lake in the distance. I resolved to go in search of
this same cascade which is deep in a shady labyrinth of
paths.</p>

<p>Well, it was a most lovely perfect day, and we left our
carriage at the terrace and started off for our ramble, Ida
with her sketch-book in hand. She was very soon hard at
work at a rustic summer-house while I plunged into a
woody tangle of paths guided only by the distant sound
of the cascades. It was toward evening and the paths
seemed quite solitary, for I met not a creature. I might
really have thought I was among the ferns and white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
birches up in Conway, or anywhere in the mountains, it
was so perfectly mossy and wild and solitary. A flock of
wild geese seemed to be making an odd sort of outlandish
noise, far in a deep, dark tangle of bushes, and it appeared
to me to produce the impression of utter solitude more
than anything else. Evidently it was a sort of wild lair
seldom invaded. I still heard the noise of the cascade
through a thicket of leaves, but could not get a sight of
it. Sometimes it seemed near and sometimes far off, but
at last I thought I hit upon a winding path that seemed to
promise to take me to it. It wound round a declivity and
I could tell by the sound I was approaching the water.
I was quite animated and ran forward till a sudden turn
brought me to the head of the cascade where there was a
railing and one seat, and as I came running down I saw
suddenly a man with a book in his hand sitting on this
seat, and it was Mr. Henderson.</p>

<p>He rose up when he saw me and looked pale, but an expression
of perfectly rapturous delight passed over his face
as I checked myself astonished.</p>

<p>"Miss Van Arsdel!" he said. "To what happy fate do I
owe this good fortune!"</p>

<p>I recovered myself and said that "I was not aware of
any <em>particular</em> good fortune in the case."</p>

<p>"Not to <em>you</em>, perhaps," he said, "but to <em>me</em>. I have seen
nothing of you for so long," he added, rather piteously.</p>

<p>"There has been nothing that I am aware of to prevent
your seeing me," I said. "If Mr. Henderson chooses
to make himself strange to his friends it is his own affair."
He looked confused and murmured something about "many
engagements and business."</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson, you will excuse me," said I, resolved not
to have this sort of thing go on any longer. "You have always
been treated at our house as an intimate and valued
friend; of late you seem to prefer to act like a ceremonious
stranger."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you mistake me, entirely, Miss Van Arsdel," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
said, eagerly. "You <em>must</em> know my feelings; you <em>must</em> appreciate
my reasons; you see why I cannot and ought not."</p>

<p>"I am quite in the dark as to both," I said. "I cannot
see any reason why we should not be on the old footing, I
am sure. You have acted of late as if you were afraid to
meet me; it is all perfectly unaccountable to me. Why
should you do so? What reason can there be?"</p>

<p>"Because," he said, with a sort of desperation, "because
I <em>love</em> you, Miss Van Arsdel. Because I always shall love
you too well to associate with you as the wife or betrothed
bride of another man."</p>

<p>"There is no occasion you should, Mr. Henderson. I am
not, so far as I understand, either wife or betrothed to any
man," I said.</p>

<p>He looked perfectly thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"Yet I heard it from the best authority."</p>

<p>"From what authority?" said I, "for I deny it."</p>

<p>"Your mother."</p>

<p>"My mother?" I was thunderstruck in my turn; here it
was to be sure. Poor mamma! I saw through the whole
mystery.</p>

<p>"Your mother told me," he went on, "that there was a
tacit engagement which was to be declared on Mr. Sydney's
return, and cautioned me against an undue intimacy."</p>

<p>"My mother," I said, "has done her utmost to persuade
me to this engagement. I refused Mr. Sydney out and out
in the beginning. She persuaded me to allow him to continue
his attentions in hope of changing my mind, but it
never has changed."</p>

<p>He grew agitated and spoke very quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me, Miss Van Arsdel, if <em>I</em> may hope for success
in making the same effort?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised if you might," said I.</p>

<p>There followed a sort of electric flash and a confusion of
wild words after this&mdash;really my dear I cannot remember
half what he said&mdash;only the next I knew, somehow, we
were walking arm in arm together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a talk we had, and what a walk up and down
those tangled alleys! going over everything and explaining
everything. It was a bright long twilight and the great
silver moon rose upon us while yet we were talking. After
a while I heard Ida calling up and down the paths for me.
She came up and met us with her sketch-book under her
arm."</p>

<p>"Ida, we're engaged, Harry and I," I said.</p>

<p>"So I thought," she said, looking at us kindly and stretching
out both hands.</p>

<p>I took one and he the other.</p>

<p>"Do you think I have any chance with your parents?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>"I think," said Ida, "that you will find trouble at first,
but you may rely on Eva, she will never change; but we
must go home."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "it would not do to introduce the matter by
getting up a domestic alarm and sending a party to drag the
lake for us; we must drive home in a peaceable, orderly
manner," and so, it being agreed among us that I should try
my diplomatic powers on mamma first, and Harry should
speak to papa afterward, we drove home.</p>

<p>Well, now Belle, it is all over&mdash;the mystery I mean; and
the struggle with the powers, that bids to begin. How odd
it is that marriage, which is a thing of all others most personal
and individual, is a thing where all your friends want
you to act to please them!</p>

<p>Mamma probably in her day felt toward papa just as I
feel, but I am sure she will be drowned in despair that I
cannot see Wat Sydney with her eyes, and that I do choose
to see Harry with mine. But it isn't mamma that is to live
with him, it is <em>I</em>; it is my fearful venture for life, not hers.
I am to give the right to have and to hold <em>me</em> till life's end.
When I think of that I wonder I am not afraid to risk it
with any man, but with him I am not. I know him so intimately
and trust him so entirely.</p>

<p>What a laugh I gave him last night, telling him how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
foolishly he had acted; he likes to have me take him off,
and seemed perfectly astonished that I had had the perspicuity
to read his feelings. These men, my dear, have a kind
of innocent stupidity in matters of this kind that is refreshing!</p>

<p>Well, if I am not mistaken, there was one blissful individual
sent home in New York last night, notwithstanding
the terrors of the '<em>stern parents</em>,' that are yet to be encountered.</p>

<p>How I do chatter on! Well, my dear Belle, you see I have
kept my word. I always told you that I would let you know
when I was engaged, the very first of any one, and now here
it is. You may make the most of it and tell whom you please,
for I shall never change. I am as firm as Ben Lomond.</p>

<p class="ph3">DOMESTIC CONSULTATIONS.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_o.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> the afternoon after the croquet party Aunt Maria
Wouvermans and Mrs. Van Arsdel, withdrawn to
the most confidential recess of the house, held
mysterious council.</p>

<p>"Well, Nelly," said Aunt Maria, "how did you think things
looked yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I thought a crisis was impending, but after all nothing
came. But you see, Maria," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, "<em>that</em>
girl! she is the most peculiar creature. She wouldn't give
him the least chance; she just held herself away from him.
Two or three times I tried to arrange that they should be
alone together, but she wouldn't. She would keep Susan and
Jane Seaton at her elbow as if they had been glued to her."</p>

<p>"It was so provoking," said Aunt Maria, "because all
the Elmores were there watching and whispering. Those
Elmores are in such an elated state on account of the wedding
in their family. You'd really think it was a royal
marriage at the very least; and they whisper about and talk
as if we had been trying to catch Sydney and couldn't; that's
what provokes me! they were all on tiptoe watching every
turn, and I did long to be able to come down on them with
an announcement! What ails Eva? Of course she must
mean to have him; no girl at her age would be fool enough
to refuse such an offer; you see she's three-and-twenty."</p>

<p>"Well, if you'll believe me, Eva actually went and gave
that croquet pin Sydney gave her to Sophie Elmore! I
overheard her urging it on her, and he overheard it too, and
I know he didn't like it; it was so very marked a thing, you
see!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eva gave that pin to Sophie Elmore! The girl is crazy.
She is too provoking for anything! I can't think what it
is, Nelly, makes your girls so singular."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wouvermans, it will appear, was one of that very
common class of good people who improve every opportunity
to show how very senseless their neighbors are compared
with themselves. The sole and only reason, as might
be gathered from her remarks, why anything disagreeable
happened to anybody, was because they did not do, or had
not done just as she should have done in their circumstances.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Van Arsdel, though conceding in general that
sister Maria was stronger and brighter than herself, was
somewhat rebellious under the process of having it insisted
in detail that every unfortunate turn of affairs was her fault,
and so she answered with some spirit.</p>

<p>"I don't see that my girls are any more singular than other
people's. Very few mothers have brought up nicer girls
than mine. Everybody says so."</p>

<p>"And I say, Nelly, they are peculiar," insisted Mrs.
Wouvermans. "There's Ida going off at her tangent! and
Miss Eva! Well! one thing, it isn't <em>my</em> fault. I've done
the very best I could in instructing them! It must come
from the Van Arsdel side of the house. I'm sure in <em>our</em>
family girls never made so much trouble. We all grew up
sensible, and took the very best offer we had, and were
married and went about our duties without any fuss. Though
of course we never had a chance like this."</p>

<p>"Now, I shouldn't wonder in the least," said Mrs. Van
Arsdel, "if Sydney should fly off to Sophie Elmore. It's
evident that she is perfectly infatuated with him! and you
know men's hearts are caught on the rebound very often."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Aunt Maria, "I shouldn't wonder, just as
Jerold Macy flew off to Blanche Sinclair, when Edith Enderly
coquetted so with him. He never would have gone to
Blanche in the world if Edith had not thrown him off.
Edith was sorry enough afterward when it was too late to
help it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>"I declare," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, "one never knows
what trouble is till one has girls at the marrying age!"</p>

<p>"It's all your own fault," said Aunt Maria, "you indulge
them too much. For my part," she continued, "I like the
French way of arranging these things. It ought not to be
left to the choice of a young silly girl. The parents ought
to arrange for her, and then the thing is settled without any
trouble. Of course people of experience in mature life can
choose better for a girl than she can choose for herself! Our
girls in America have too much liberty. If I had daughters
to bring up I should bring them up so that they would never
think of disputing what I told them."</p>

<p>"So you are always saying, Maria," said Mrs. Van Arsdel,
"it's quite safe to say what you'll do when you haven't any,
but it's very provoking to me. I only wish you had Ida and
Eva to manage."</p>

<p>"I only wish I had!" said Aunt Maria. "I should have
had them both well married by this time. There shouldn't
be any of this kind of nonsense that you allow. I'd set down
my foot. I <em>wouldn't</em> have it. My daughters <em>should</em> obey me.
You let them make a perfect nose-of-wax of you. They
treat you in any way they please."</p>

<p>"You always think so much of yourself, Maria, and whatever
happens you turn round and blame me. I wish to mercy
you'd <em>had</em> children and then you'd see! People who haven't
are always delighted with themselves and always criticising
people who have. If you had a family of children to manage
they'd soon bring you down."</p>

<p>"Well, Nelly, you'll just see, you'll have a lot of old maids
on your hands, that's all," said Aunt Maria. "Ida is a gone
case now, and Eva is on the certain road. Girls that are so
difficult and romantic and can't tell their own mind are sure
to make old maids at last. There was Ellen Gilliflower,
and Jane Seabright, they might both have had houses and
horses and carriages of their own if they had taken offers
when they could get them."</p>

<p>"You know poor Jane lost her lover."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure. Well, he was dead, wasn't he? and she
couldn't marry him, but was that any reason why she never
should marry anybody? There was John Smithson would
have put her at the head of one of the best establishments
about New York, and she might have had her own coupé and
horses just as Mrs. Smithson does now. It's all this ridiculous
idea about loving. Why, girls <em>can</em> love anybody they'd
a mind to, and if I had a daughter she <em>should</em>."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know, Maria," said Mrs. Van Arsdel. "I
think it is a pretty serious thing to force a daughter's affections."</p>

<p>"Fiddlestick upon affections, Nelly, don't you begin to
talk. It makes me perfectly sick to hear the twaddle about
it. People in good circumstances always like each other
well enough, and any girl can get along with any man that
puts her in a good position and takes good care of her. If
Ida had been <em>made</em> to marry a good man when she first
came out of school she never would have gone off at all these
tangents, and she'd have been a contented woman, and so
would Eva. She ought to be <em>made</em> to marry Wat Sydney,
it is a tempting of Providence to let the thing drag on so.
Now, if Sydney was like Sim Rivington, I wouldn't say a
word. I think Polly's conduct is perfectly abominable, and
if Sim goes on getting drunk and raises a hell upon earth
at home Polly may just have herself to thank for it, for she
was told all about him. She did it with her eyes open, but
Eva's case is different."</p>

<p>At this moment the door-bell rung, and the waiter
brought in a letter on a silver salver. Both ladies pounced
upon it, and Aunt Maria saying, "It's to you, from Sydney,"
eagerly broke it open and began reading.</p>

<p>"I should think, sister," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, in an injured
tone, "<em>I</em> might be allowed the first reading of my
own letters."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, don't be so peevish," said Aunt Maria,
pushing it petulantly toward her. "If you don't want me
to take any interest in your affairs I'm sure I don't see why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
I should. I'll go, and you may manage them yourself."</p>

<p>"But, Maria," said poor Mrs. Van Arsdel, apologetically,
"one naturally has the wish to see one's own letters first."</p>

<p>"Well, mercy on us, child, don't be in a passion about it,"
said Aunt Maria, "you've got your letter, haven't you?
Do read it, and you'll see it's just as I thought. That girl
has offended him with her airs and graces, and he is just on
the point of giving her up."</p>

<p>"But, you see, he says that he still desires to propose
to her," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, reading, "only that as her
manner to him is so marked he does not wish to expose
himself to another refusal."</p>

<p>"Well," said Aunt Maria, "now you see, Nelly, after all,
that letter leaves the game in Eva's own hands. If now she
will behave herself and let you invite him to an interview
and treat him properly, it can all be settled. The
letter, in fact, amounts to a proposal in form. Now, Nelly,
that girl <em>must</em> be made to behave herself. I wish I could
put some pluck into you; you must be decided with her."</p>

<p>"It's of no use, sister, you don't know Eva. She's an
easy child to be coaxed, but she has a terrible will of her
own. The only way to manage her is through her affections.
I can't bear to cross her, for she always was a good
child."</p>

<p>"Well, then, tell her just how critical the state of the
family is. She may have it in her power to save her father
from failure. It may be just life or death with us all.
Put it to her strongly. It would be a pretty thing, indeed,
if instead of being mistress of Clairmont and that place
at Newport, we should all be driven to take second-rate
houses and live like nobodies, just for her foolish fancies.
You ought to frighten her, Nelly. Set it out strongly. Appeal
to her affections."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall do my best," said Mrs. Van Arsdel.</p>

<p>"Where is she? let <em>me</em> talk with her," said Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>"She and Ida are both gone driving in the Park this afternoon,
but after all, sister, I think <em>I</em> had best manage it. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
think I understand Eva better than you do. She would do
more for me than for anybody, I think, for the child is very
affectionate."</p>

<p>"There can't be anybody else in the case, can there?"
said Aunt Maria. "I began to think it rather imprudent
to have that Henderson round so much, but of late he seems
to have stopped coming."</p>

<p>"I flatter myself, I managed <em>him</em>," said Mrs. Van Arsdel,
with complacency. "I gave him a little motherly admonition
that had a wonderful effect. After all it was a duty
I owed to him, poor youth! Eva is wonderfully fascinating,
and I could see he was getting too much interested in
her. I have a regard for him. He is a nice fellow."</p>

<p>"I intended to have him take Ida," said Aunt Maria.
"That would have been the proper thing to do."</p>

<p>"Well, Maria, I should think you might have found
out by this time that everybody in the world isn't going
to walk in the ways you mark out for them."</p>

<p>"It would be better for them if they would," said Aunt
Maria. "If I had had the bringing up of your children from
the beginning, Nelly, and you had never interfered, I think
you would have seen results that you never will see now.
It seems mysterious that Providence shouldn't send children
to those best fitted to bring them up. Well, you must
do the best you can. What time is it? Dear me, it is
almost dinner time and I have a new table girl to-day. I
expect she'll have everything topsy-turvey. I'll call round
to-morrow to see how things come on."</p>

<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_e.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Eva Van Arsdel</span> was seated in her apartment in
all that tremulous flush of happiness and hope,
that confusion of feeling, which a young girl experiences
when she thinks that the great crisis of her life
has been past, and her destiny happily decided.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," she said to herself, "I like him, I like him;
and I am going to like him, no matter what mamma, or
Aunt Maria, or all the world say. I'll stand by him through
life and death."</p>

<p>At this moment her mother came into the room.</p>

<p>"Dear me! Eva, child, not gone to bed yet! Why,
what's the matter? how flushed your cheeks are! Why,
you look really feverish."</p>

<p>"Do I?" said Eva, hardly knowing what she was saying.
"Well, I suppose that is becoming, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Aren't you well?" said her mother. "Does your head
ache?"</p>

<p>"Well? certainly, nicely; never better, mamma dear,"
said Eva, caressingly, coming and seating herself on her
mother's knee, and putting her arm around her neck&mdash;"never
better, mother."</p>

<p>"Well, Eva, then I am glad of it. I just wanted a few
minutes alone with you to-night. I have got something to
tell you"&mdash;and she drew a letter from her pocket. "Here's
this letter from Mr. Sydney; I want to read you something
from it."</p>

<p>"Oh dear mamma! what's the use? Don't you think it
rather stupid, reading letters?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, Mr. Sydney is such a <em>good</em> man, and so
devoted to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't the least objection, mamma, to his being a
good man. Long may he be so. But as to his being devoted
to me, I am sorry for it."</p>

<p>"At least, Eva, just read this letter&mdash;there's a dear; and
I am sure you must see how like a gentleman he writes."</p>

<p>Eva took the letter from her mother's hand, and ran it
over hurriedly.</p>

<p>"All no use, mamma, dear," she said, when she had done.
"It won't hurt him. He'll get over this just as people do
with the chicken pox. The fact is, mamma, Mr. Sydney is
a man that can't bear to be balked in anything that he has
once undertaken to do. It is not that he loves me so
very dreadfully, but he has set out to have me. If he
could have got me, ten to one, he would have tired of me
before now. You know he said that he never cared anything
about a girl that he knew he could have. It is
simply and only because I have kept myself out of his way
and been hard to get that he wants me. If he once had
me for a wife, I should be all well enough, but I should be
<em>got</em>, and he'd be off after the next thing he could not get.
That's just his nature, mamma."</p>

<p>"But, Eva dear, such a <em>fine</em> man as he is."</p>

<p>"I do not see that he is so very fine."</p>

<p>"But, Eva, only look at the young men that girls marry!
Why, there's that young Rivington; he's drunk three nights
in a week, so they tell me. And there are worse stories
than that about him. He has been bad in every kind of
way that a man could be bad. And yet, Polly Elmore is
perfectly crazy with delight to have her daughter get him.
And here's Wat Sydney, who, everybody says, is always
perfectly sober and correct."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma dear, if it is only a sober, correct man
that you want me to have, there's that Mr. Henderson, just
as sober and correct, and a great deal more cultivated and
agreeable."</p>

<p>"How absurd of you, my daughter! Mr. Henderson has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
not anything to support a wife on. He is a good moral
young man, I admit, and agreeable, and has talent and all
that; but my dear Eva, you are not fitted to contend with
poverty. You must marry a man that can support you in
the position that you have always been in."</p>

<p>"Whether I love him or not, mamma?"</p>

<p>"My dear Eva, you would, of course, love your husband.
A man that is able to take care of you and get you everything
that you want&mdash;give you every wish of your heart&mdash;you
would love of course."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, I have got a man that does exactly that
for me, now," said Eva, "and I don't need another. That's
just what papa does for me. And now, when I marry, I
want a companion that suits me. I have got now all the
bracelets, and jewelry, and finger rings that I can think of;
and if I wanted forty more I could tease them out of papa
any day, or kiss them out of him. Pa always gets me everything
I want; so I don't see what I want of Mr. Sydney."</p>

<p>"Well, now, my dear Eva, I must speak to you seriously.
You are old enough now not to be talked to like a child.
The fact is, my darling, there is nothing so insecure as
our life here. Your father, my love, is reported to be a
great deal richer than he is. Of course we have to keep
up the idea, because it helps his business. But the last two
or three years he has met with terrible losses, and I have
seen him sometimes so nervous about our family expenditures
that, really, there was no comfort in life. But, then,
we had this match in view. We supposed, of course, that
it was coming off. And such a splendid settlement on you
would help the family every way. Mr. Sydney is a very
generous man; and the use of his capital, the credit that
the marriage would give to your father in business circles,
would be immense. And then, my child, just think of the
establishment you would have! Why, there is not such an
establishment in the country as his place on the North
River! You saw it yesterday. What could you ask more?
And there is that villa at Newport. You might be there in
the Summer, and have all you sisters there. And he is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
man of the most splendid taste as to equipages and furniture,
and everything of that sort. And as I said before, he
is a good man."</p>

<p>"But, mamma, mamma, it will never do. Not if he had
the East and West Indies. All that can't buy your little
Eva. Tell me, now, mamma dear, was pa a rich man when
you married him&mdash;I mean when you fell in love with him?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, dear, not very; though people always said that
he was a man that would rise."</p>

<p>"But you didn't begin in a house like this, mamma.
You began at the beginning and helped him up, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, dear, we did begin in a quiet way; and I had
to live pretty carefully the first years of my life; and
worked hard, and know all about it; and I want to save
you from going through the same that I did."</p>

<p>"May be if you did I should not turn out as you are now.
But really, mother, if pa is embarrassed, why do we live
so? Why don't we economize? I am sure I am willing to."</p>

<p>"Oh, darling! we mustn't. We mustn't make any change;
because, if the idea should once get running that there is
any difficulty about money, everybody would be down on
your father. We have to keep everything going, and
everything up, or else things would go abroad that would
injure his credit; and he could not get money for his
operations. He is engaged in great operations now that
will bring in millions if they succeed."</p>

<p>"And if they don't succeed," said Eva, "then I suppose
that we shall lose millions&mdash;is that it?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, it is just as I tell you, we rich people live on
a very uncertain eminence, and for that reason I wanted to
see my darling daughter settled securely."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, now I will tell you what I have been
thinking of. Since 'riches make to themselves wings and
fly away,' what is the sense of marrying a man whose main
recommendation is, that he is rich? Because that is the
thing that makes Mr. Sydney more, for instance, than Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Henderson, or any other nice gentleman we know. Now
what if I should marry Mr. Sydney, who, to say the truth,
dear mamma, I do not fancy, and who is rather tiresome
to me&mdash;and then some fine morning his banks should fail,
his railroads burst up, and his place on the North River,
and his villa at Newport have to be sold, and he and I
have to take a little unfashionable house together, and
rough it&mdash;what then? Why, then, when it came to that,
I should wish that I had chosen a more entertaining companion.
For there isn't a thing that I am interested in
that I can talk with him about. You see, dear mother,
we have to take it 'for better or for worse;' and as there
is always danger that the wheel may turn, by and by
it may come so that we'll have nothing but the man himself
left. It seems to me that we should choose our man
with great care. He should be like the pearl of great
price, the Bible speaks of, for whom we would be glad
to sell everything. It should be somebody we could be
happy with if we lost all beside. And when I marry,
mother, it will be with a man that I feel is all that to me."</p>

<p>"Well, Eva dear, where'll you find such a man?"</p>

<p>"What if I had found him, mother&mdash;or thought I had?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, child?"</p>

<p>"Mother, I have found the man that I love, and he loves
me, and we are engaged."</p>

<p>"Eva, child! I would not have thought this of you.
Why haven't you told me before?"</p>

<p>"Because, mamma, it was only this afternoon that I
found out that he loved me and wanted me to be his wife."</p>

<p>"And may I presume to ask now who it is?" said Mrs.
Van Arsdel, in a tone of pique.</p>

<p>"Dear mother, it is Harry Henderson."</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson! Well, I do think that is too dishonorable;
when I told him your relations with Mr. Sydney."</p>

<p>"Mother, you gave him to understand that I was engaged
to Mr. Sydney, and I told him, this afternoon, that
I was not, and never would be. He was honorable. After
you had that conversation with him, he avoided our house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
a long time, and avoided me. I was wretched about it,
and he was wretched; but this afternoon we met accidentally
in the Park; and I insisted on knowing from him
why he avoided us so. And, at last, I found out all; and
he found out all. We understand each other perfectly now,
and nothing can ever come between us. Mother, I would
go with him to the ends of the earth. There is nothing
that I do not feel able to do or suffer for him. And I
am glad and proud of myself to know that I can love him
as I do."</p>

<p>"Oh well, poor child! I do not know what we shall do,"
said Mrs. Van Arsdel, with profound dejection.</p>

<p>"Deary mother, I will do everything I can to help you,
and everything I can to help papa. I do not believe
there is one of us children that would not. And I think
it is true, what Ida is always telling us, that it would be
a great deal better for us if we had less, and had to depend
on ourselves and use our own faculties more. There are
the boys in college; there is no need of their having spending-money
as they do. And I know if papa would tell
them of his difficulties it would make men of them, just
as it would make a woman of me."</p>

<p>"Well, I do not know," said Mrs. Van Arsdel. "Your
father has not told me of any particular embarrassments,
only I see he is anxious and nervous, and I know him so
well that I always know when his affairs trouble him. And
this is a great blow to me, Eva."</p>

<p>"Well, dear mother, I am very sorry it is so; but I
cannot help it. It would be wicked for me, mother, to
marry any other man when I love Harry as I do. Love
is not a glove that you can take off as you please. It is
something very different. Now, with him, I never felt
tired. I always like to be with him; I always like to talk
with him; he never makes me nervous; I never wish he
was gone; he can always understand me, and I can understand
him. We can almost tell what the other is thinking
of without speaking. And I will risk our not being happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
together. So please do, dear mother, look a little cheerful
about it. Let me be happy in my own way."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I must," said Mrs. Van Arsdel, with a
deep sigh, taking up the lamp. "You always did have
your own way, Eva."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, mother dear; some day you'll be glad of it.
Good night."</p>

<p class="ph3">FURTHER CONSULTATIONS.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">After</span> the departure of her mother, Eva in vain
tried to compose herself to sleep. Her cheeks
were flushed, and her brain was in a complete
whirl. Her mother had said and hinted just enough about
the financial condition of the family to fill her with vague
alarms. She walked uneasily up and down her luxurious
chamber, all whose appointments spoke of wealth and
taste; and it was with an unpleasant feeling of insecurity
that she regarded the pictures and statues and sofas, and
all the charming arrangements, in perfecting which her
father had always allowed her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i> as to money.
She reflected uneasily, that in making all these expensive
arrangements, she had ordered simply what pleased her
fancy, without inquiry as to price, and without ever glancing
over a bill to know the result; and now, she found herself
affianced to a young man without any other resources
than those which must come from the exertion of his talents,
seconded by prudence and economy. And here, again,
offered to her acceptance, was another marriage, which
would afford her the means of gratifying every taste, and
of continuing to live in all those habits of easy luxury
and careless expenses that she could not but feel were very
agreeable to her. Not for one moment did she feel an
inclination, or a temptation, to purchase that luxury, and
that ease, by the sale of herself; but still, when she thought
of her lover&mdash;of the difficulties that he must necessarily
meet, of the cares which she must bring upon him&mdash;she
asked herself, "Was it not an act of injustice to him to
burden him with so incapable and helpless a wife, as she
feared she should prove?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I <em>am not</em> incapable," she said to herself, "and I
<em>will not</em> be helpless. I have strength in me, and I will use
it; I will show that I am good for something. I wonder if
it is true that papa is embarrassed. If he is, I wish he
would trust us; I wish he would tell us at once, and let
us help him economize. I would do it; I am sure we all
would do it."</p>

<p>It was in vain, under the pressure of these thoughts,
to try to compose herself to sleep; and, at last, she passed
into her sister Ida's room, who, with her usual systematic
regularity as to hours, had for a long time been in the enjoyment
of quiet slumber.</p>

<p>"Ida, dear!" she said, stooping over and speaking to her
sister, "Ida, look here!"</p>

<p>Ida opened her eyes, and sat up in bed. "Why Eva,
child, not gone to bed yet? What is the matter with you?
You will certainly ruin your health with these irregular
hours."</p>

<p>"Oh Ida, I am so nervous I can't sleep! I am sorry to
disturb you, but, indeed, I want to talk to you about
something that worries me; and you know you are always
gone before I am up in the morning."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, what is it?" said Ida, stroking her head.</p>

<p>"Do you know mamma has just been into my room
with a letter from Mr. Sydney. He is coming into the
field again, and has written to mamma, and mamma has
been in talking to me till I am just ready to cry. Now,
Ida, you know all that took place between Mr. Henderson
and me yesterday in the Park; we are engaged, are we
not, as much as two people can be?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you are," said Ida, decisively.</p>

<p>"Well now, mamma is so distressed and disappointed."</p>

<p>"You told her about it, then?" said Ida.</p>

<p>"Certainly; yes, I told her all about it; and oh, Ida!
what do you think? mamma really made me feel as if
something dreadful was going to happen in the family, that
papa was getting embarrassed in his business, and perhaps
we might all fail and come to ruin if I did not help him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
by marrying Mr. Sydney. Now, do you think it would be
right for me? It certainly can not be my duty!"</p>

<p>"Ask yourself that question," said Ida; "think what you
must promise and vow in marriage."</p>

<p>"To be sure! and how wicked it would be to promise
and vow all that to one man when I <em>know</em> that I love another
one better!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Ida, "asking a woman to take false marriage
vows to save her family, or her parents from trouble,
is just like asking her to steal money, or forge a false note
to save them. Eva, you cannot do it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Eva, "that is what I told mamma. But, Ida
dear, is it really true, do you think, that papa is troubled in
his business?"</p>

<p>"Papa is not a man that would speak freely to any woman
on business matters," said Ida, "not even to me; but I
know that his liabilities and ventures are terrific; and
nothing would surprise me less than to have this whole air-castle
that we have been living in dissolve like a morning
mist, and let us down on the pavement. All I have to say
is, that if it comes it is just what I have been preparing for
all my life. I have absolutely refused to be made such a
helpless doll as young girls in our position commonly are.
I have determined that I would keep my faculties bright,
and my bodily health firm and strong; and that all these
luxuries should not become a necessity to me, so but what
I could take care of myself, and take care of others, without
them. And all I have to say is, if a crash comes it will find
<em>me</em> ready, and it won't crush me."</p>

<p>"But, Ida, don't you think it would be a great deal better
if we would all begin now to economize, and live very
differently? Why, I am sure I would be willing to move
out of this house, and rent it, or sell it, and live in a smaller
one, and give up the carriages and horses. We could live a
great deal cheaper and more quietly than we do, and yet
have everything that I care about. Yes, I'd even rather sell
the pictures&mdash;all except a few&mdash;and feel safe and independent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
than to live in this sort of glittering, uncertain way,
and be pressed to marry a man that I do not love, for the
sake of getting out of it."</p>

<p>"Well, dear," said Ida, "you never will get Aunt Maria to
let ma stop running this race with the Elmores till the last
gun fires, and the ship is ready to sink; that's the whole
of it. It is <em>what people will say</em>, and the thought of being
pitied by their set, and being beaten in the race, that will
go further than anything else. If you talk about any drawing
in of expenses, they say that we must not do anything
of the sort&mdash;that it will injure papa's credit. Now I know
enough of what things cost, and what business estimates
are, to know that we are spending at a tremendous rate. If
we had an entailed estate settled upon us with an annual
income of two or three hundred thousand dollars, there
might be some sense in living as we do; but when all depends
on the value of stocks that are going up to-day and
down to-morrow, there is never any knowing what may
happen; and <em>that</em> is what I have always felt. Father made
a lucky hit by investing in stocks that doubled, and trebled,
and quadrupled in value; but now, there is a combination
against them, and they are falling. I know it gives father
great anxiety; and, as I said before, I should not wonder in
the least&mdash;nothing would surprise me less, than that we
should have a great crisis one of these times."</p>

<p>"Poor Harry!" said Eva, "it was the thought of my being
an heiress that made him hesitate so long; perhaps he'll
have a chance to take me without that obstacle. Ida, do
you think it would be right and just in me to let him take
such an inefficient body as I am? Am I quite spoiled, do
you think&mdash;past all redemption?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, darling!" said Ida; "I have good hopes of you.
In the first place, a woman that has strength of mind
enough to be true to her love against all the pressure that
has been brought to bear on you, has strength of mind to do
anything that may be required of her. Of course, dear, it
will come to the practical point of living in an entirely different
style from what we now live in; and you must count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the cost. In the first place, you must give up fashionable
society altogether. You must consent to be pitied and
wondered at as one that has fallen out of her sphere and
gone down in the world. All the Mrs. Grundys will stop
calling on you; and you won't have any turn-out in the
Park; and you may have to take a small house on an unfashionable
street, and give your mind to the business of
calculating expenses, and watching outgoes and incomes."</p>

<p>"Well, now, seriously, Ida, I shouldn't mind these things
a bit. I don't care a penny for Mrs. Grundy, nor her works
and ways. As to the little house, there'll be the less care to
keep it; and as to its being on an unfashionable street, what
do I care for that? Nobody that I really care for would fail
to come and see me, let me live where I would. And Harry
and I just agree in our views of life. We are not going to
live for the world, but for ourselves and our friends. We'll
have the nicest little home, where every true friend of ours
shall feel as much at home as we do. And don't you think,
Ida, that I should make a good manager? Oh! I know that
I could make a house pretty&mdash;charming&mdash;on ever so little
money, just as I get up a Spring hat, sometimes, out of odds
and ends; and I quite like the idea of having it to do. Of
course, poor papa, I don't want him to fail; and I hope he
won't; but I'm something like you, Ida, if all should go to
ruin, I feel as if I could stand up, now, that I have got Harry
to stand up with me. We can begin quietly at first, and
make our fortune together. I have thought of ever so
many things that I could do for him to help him. Do you
know, Ida,&mdash;(I rather guess you'll laugh)&mdash;that I brought
home his gloves and mended them this very evening? I
told him I was going to begin to take care of him. You see
I'll make it cheaper for him in a thousand ways&mdash;I know I
can. He never shall find me a burden. I am quite impatient
to be able to show what I can do."</p>

<p>"To begin, darling," said Ida, "one thing you must do is,
to take care of your body; no late hours to waste your
little brain. And so don't you think you had better go to
your room and go quietly to sleep?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh Ida! I am going to be so good and so regular after
to-night; but to-night, you know, is a kind of exception.
Girls don't get engaged every day of their lives, and so you
must forgive me if I do make a run upon you to-night.
The fact is, what with my talk with Harry this afternoon,
and with mamma to-night, and all the fuss that I see impending,
my eyes are just as wide open as they can be; and
I don't believe I could go to sleep if I were to try. Oh Ida!
Harry told me all about his mother, and all about that
handsome cousin of his, that he has spoken of so many
times. Do you know I used to have such worries of mind
about that cousin? I was perfectly sure that she stood in
my way. And now, Ida, I have a most capital idea about
her! She wants to go to France to study, just as you do;
and how nice it would be if you could join company and go
together."</p>

<p>"It would be pleasant," said Ida. "I must confess I
don't like the idea of being '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">damsel errant</i>,' wandering off
entirely alone in the world; and if I leave you, darling, I
shall want somebody to speak to. But come, my dear little
pussy, you must lie down and shut your eyes, and say your
prayers, and try to go to sleep."</p>

<p>"You darling good little doctor, you," said Eva, "it is too
bad of me to keep you up! There, I will be good&mdash;see how
good I am! Good night"&mdash;and kissing her sister, she
sought her own apartment.</p>

<p class="ph3">MAKING LOVE TO ONE'S FATHER-IN-LAW.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_l.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Life</span> has many descents from romance to reality
that are far from agreeable. But every exalted
hour, and every charming passage in our mortal
pilgrimage, is a luxury that has to be paid for with something
disagreeable. The German story teller, Tieck, has
a pretty legend of a magical region where were marvelous
golden castles, and fountains, and flowers, and bright-winged
elves, living a life of ceaseless pleasure; but all
this was visible only to the anointed eyes of some favored
mortal to whom was granted the vision. To all others
this elfin country was a desolate wilderness. I had had
given me within a day or two that vision of Wonderland,
and wandered&mdash;scarce knowing whether in the body or
out&mdash;in its enchanted bowers. The first exhilarating joy
of the moment when every mist rose up from the landscape
of love; when there was perfect understanding, perfect
union, perfect rest; was something that transfigured life.
But having wandered in this blessed country and spoken
the tongue of angels, I was now to return to every-day
regions and try to translate its marvels and mysteries into
the vernacular of mortals. In short, I was to wait upon Mr.
Van Arsdel and ask of him the hand of his daughter.</p>

<p>Now however charming, with suitable encouragement,
to make love to a beautiful lady, making love to a
prospective father-in-law is quite another matter.</p>

<p>Men are not as a general thing inclined to look sympathetically
on other men in love with any fine woman of
their acquaintance, and are rather provoked than otherwise
to have them accepted. "What any woman can see in
that fellow!" is a sort of standing problem. But possessors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
of daughters, are, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a fortiori</i>, enemies ready made to
every pretender to their hands. My own instincts made
me aware of this, and I could easily fancy that had I a
daughter like Eva I should be ready to shoot the fellow
who came to take her from me.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Arsdel, it is true, had showed me, hitherto,
in his quiet way, marked favor. He was seldom much of
a talker, though a shrewd observer of all that was said
by others. He had listened silently to all our discussions
and conversations in Ida's library, and oftentimes to the
reading of the articles I had subjected to the judgment
of the ladies; sometimes, though very rarely, interposing
little bits of common sense&mdash;criticism which showed keen
good sense, and knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Arsdel, like many of our merchant princes,
had come from a rural distinct, and an early experience
of the hard and frugal life of a farm. Good sense, acute
observation, an ability to take wide and clear views of
men and things, and an incorruptible integrity, had been
the means of his rise to his present elevation. He was a
true American man in another respect, and that was his
devotion to women. In America, where we have a clear
democracy, women hold that influence over men that is
exerted by the aristocracy in other countries. They are
something to be looked up to, petted, and courted. The
human mind seems to require something of this kind.
The faith and fealty that the middle-class Englishman
has toward his nobility is not all snobbery. It has something
of poetry in it&mdash;it is his romance of life. Up in those
airy regions where walk the nobility, he is at liberty to
fancy some higher, finer types of manhood and womanhood
than he sees in the ordinary ways of life, and he
adores the unseen and unknown. The American life
would become vulgar and common-place did not a chivalrous
devotion to women come in to supply the place of
recognized orders of nobility. The true democrat sees no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
superior in rank among men, but all women are by
courtesy his superiors.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Arsdel had married a beauty and a belle.
When she chose him from among a crowd of suitors he
could scarcely believe his own eyes or ears, or help marveling
at the wondrous grace of the choice; and, as he told
her so, Mrs. Van Arsdel believed him, and their subsequent
life was arranged on that understanding. The Van Arsdel
house was an empire where women ruled, though as the
queen was a pretty, motherly woman, her reign was easy
and flowery.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Arsdel delighted in the combinations of business
for its own sake. It was his form of mental activity.
He liked the effort, the strife, the care, the labor, the
success of winning; but when money was once won he
cared not a copper for all those forms of luxury and
show, for the pride, pomp, and circumstance of fashion,
which were all in all to his wife.</p>

<p>In his secret heart he considered the greater part of
the proceedings in and about his splendid establishment as
a rather expensive species of humbug; but then it was
what the women wanted and desired, and he took it all
quietly and without comment. I felt somewhat nervous
when I asked a private interview with him in Ida's
library.</p>

<p>"I have told mamma, Harry," whispered Eva, "and she
is beginning to get over it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Arsdel received me with an air of patient endurance,
as if I had been the toothache or any of the other
inevitable inflictions of life, Miss Alice was distant and
reserved, and only Ida was cordial.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Van Arsdel dry, cold, and wary, not in the
least encouraging any sentimental effusion, and therefore I
proceeded to speak to him with as matter-of-fact directness
as if the treaty related to a bag of wool.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Arsdel, I love your daughter. She has honored
me so far as to accept of my love, and I have her permission
to ask your consent to our marriage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>He took off his spectacles, wiped them deliberately while
I was speaking, and coughed drily.</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson," he said, "I have always had a great
respect for you so far as I knew you, but I must confess I
don't know why I should want to give you my daughter."</p>

<p>"Simply, sir, because in the order of nature you must
give her to somebody, and I have the honor to be chosen
by her."</p>

<p>"Eva could do better, her mother thinks."</p>

<p>"I am aware that Miss Van Arsdel could marry a man
with more money than I have, but none who would love
her more or be more devoted to her happiness. Besides
I have the honor to be the man of her choice, and perhaps
you may be aware that Miss Eva is a young lady
of very decided preferences."</p>

<p>He smiled drily, and looked at me with a funny twinkle
in his eye.</p>

<p>"Eva has always been used to having her own way," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Then, my dear sir, I must beg leave to say that the
choice of a companion for life is a place where a lady has
a good right to insist on her own way."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Henderson, you may be right. But perhaps
her parents ought to insist that she shall not make an
imprudent marriage."</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Arsdel, I do not conceive that I am proposing
an imprudent marriage. I have not wealth to offer, it is
true, but I have a reasonable prospect of being able to
support a wife and family. I have good firm health, I
have good business habits, I have a profession which already
assures me a certain income, and an influential
position in society."</p>

<p>"What do you call your profession?"</p>

<p>"Literature," I replied.</p>

<p>He looked skeptical, and I added&mdash;"Yes, Mr. Van Arsdel,
in our day literature is a profession in which one may hope
for both fame and money."</p>

<p>"It is rather an uncertain one, isn't it?" said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think not. A business which proposes to supply a
great, permanent, constantly increasing demand you must
admit to be a good one. The demand for current reading
is just as wide and steady as any demand of our life,
and the men who undertake to supply it have as certain a
business as those that undertake to supply cotton cloth,
or railroad iron. At this day fortunes are being made in
and by literature."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Arsdel drummed on the table abstractedly.</p>

<p>"Now," said I, determined to speak in the language of
men and things, "the case is just this: If a young man
of good, reliable habits, good health, and good principles,
has a capital of seventy thousand dollars invested in a fair
paying business, has he not a prospect of supporting a
family in comfort?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Van Arsdel, regarding me curiously, "I
should call that a good beginning."</p>

<p>"Well," rejoined I, "my health, my education, my power
of doing literary work, are this capital. They secure to me
for the next year an income equal to that of seventy thousand
dollars at ten per cent. Now, I think a capital of that
amount invested in a <em>man</em>, is quite as safe as the same
sum invested in any stocks whatever. It seems to me
that in our country a <em>man</em> who knows how to take care of
his health is less likely to become unproductive in income
than any stock you can name."</p>

<p>"There is something in that, I admit," replied Mr. Van
Arsdel.</p>

<p>"And there's something in <em>this</em>, too, papa," said Eva, who
entered at this moment and could not resist her desire to
dip her oar in the current of conversation, "and that is,
that an investment that you have got to take for better or
worse and can't sell or get rid of all your life, had better be
made in something you are sure you will like."</p>

<p>"And are you sure of that in this case, Pussy?" said her
father, pinching her cheek.</p>

<p>"Tolerably, as men go. Mr. Henderson is the least tiresome
man of my acquaintance, and you know, papa, it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
time I took somebody; you don't want me to go into a
convent, do you?"</p>

<p>"How about poor Mr. Sydney?"</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Sydney has just called, and I have invited
him to a private audience and convinced him that I am
not, in the least, the person to make him happy&mdash;and he is
one of the sort that feel that it is of the last importance
that he should be made happy."</p>

<p>"Well, well! Mr. Henderson, I presume you have seen,
in the course of your observations, that this is one of the
houses where the women rule. You and Eva will have
to settle it with her mother."</p>

<p>"Then I am to understand," exclaimed I, "that, as far as
<em>you</em> are concerned&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I <em>submit</em>," said Mr. Van Arsdel.</p>

<p>"The ayes have it, then," said Eva.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that, young lady," said Mr. Van
Arsdel, "if I may judge by the way your mother lamented
to me last night."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all Aunt Maria! You see, papa, this is an
age of revolution, and there's going to be a revolution in
the Aunt Maria dynasty in our house. She has governed
mamma and all the rest of us long enough, and now
she must go down and I must rule. Harry and I are going
to start a new era and have things all our own way. I'm
going to crown him King, and he then will crown me
Queen, and then we shall proceed to rule and reign in our
own dominions, and Aunt Maria, and Mrs. Grundy, and all
the rest of them, may help themselves; they can't hinder
us. We shall be happy in our own way, without consulting
them."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" said Mr. Van Arsdel, following with an
amused eye, a pirouette Eva executed at the conclusion of
her speech, "you young folks are venturesome."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, I am 'The woman who dared,'" said Eva.</p>

<p>"'Nothing venture, nothing have,'" quoted I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eva knows no more about managing money than a
this year's robin," said her father.</p>

<p>"Yet this year's robins know how to build respectable
nests when their time comes," said she. "They don't bother
about investments and stocks and all those things, but
sing and have a good time. It all comes right for them,
and I don't doubt it will for us."</p>

<p>"You have a decided talent for spending money most
agreeably, I confess," said Mr. Van Arsdel.</p>

<p>"Now, papa, it's too bad for you to be running down
your own daughter! I'm not appreciated. I have a world
of undeveloped genius for management. Harry has agreed
to teach me accounts, and as I belong to the class who
always grow wiser than their teachers, I'm sure that before
six months are over I shall be able to suggest improved
methods to him. When I get a house you'll all be glad
to come and see me, I shall make it so bright and sunny
and funny, and give you such lovely things to eat; and
in <em>my</em> house everybody shall do just as they please, and
have their own way if they can find out what it is. I
know people will like it."</p>

<p>"I believe you, Pussy," said Mr. Van Arsdel; "but
houses don't grow on bushes, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, haven't I six thousand dollars, all my own, that
grandma left me?"</p>

<p>"And how much of a house do you think that would
buy?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps as big a one as you and mother began in."</p>

<p>"You never would be satisfied with such a house as we
began in."</p>

<p>"Why not? Are we any better than you were?"</p>

<p>"No. But nowadays no young folks are contented to
do as we did."</p>

<p>"Then, papa, you are going to see a new thing upon the
earth, for Harry and I am going to be pattern folks for
being rational and contented. We are going to start out
on a new tack and bring in the golden age. But, bless me!
there's Aunt Maria coming down the street! Now, Harry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
comes the tug of war. I am going now to emancipate mamma
and proclaim the new order of things," and out she
flitted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson," said Mr. Van Arsdel, when she had
gone, "I think it is about certain that I am to look on you
as a future member of our family. I'll be fair with you,
that you may take steps with your eyes open. My daughters
are supposed to be heiresses, but, as things are tending,
in a very short time I may be put back to where I started
in life and have all to begin over. My girls will have
nothing. I see such a crisis impending and I have no
power to help it."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," said I, "while I shall be sorry for your
trouble, and hope it may not come, I shall be only too glad
to prove my devotion to Eva."</p>

<p>"It is evident," said Mr. Arsdel, "that her heart is set on
you, and, after all, the only true comfort is in having the one
you want. I myself never cared for fashion, Mr. Henderson,
nor parties, nor any of this kind of fuss and show the
women think so much of; and I believe that Eva is a
little like me. I like to go back to the old place in summer
and eat huckleberries and milk, and see the cows come
home from pasture, and sit in father's old arm-chair. It
wouldn't take so much running and scheming and hard
thinking and care to live, if folks were all of my mind.
Why, up in New Hampshire where I came from, there's
scarcely ever an estate administered upon that figures up
more than five thousand dollars, and yet they all live well&mdash;have
nice houses, nice tables, give money in charity, and
make a good thing of life."</p>

<p>There was something really quite pathetic in this burst
of confidence from the worthy man. Perhaps I was the
first one to whom he had confessed the secret apprehensions
with which he was struggling.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Henderson, you never can tell about investments.
Stocks that seem to stand as firm as the foundations
of the earth, that the very oldest and shrewdest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
longest-headed put into, run down and depreciate&mdash;and
when they get running you can't draw out, you see. Now I
advanced capital for the new Lightning Line Railroad to the
amount of two hundred thousand, and pledged my Guatemala
stock for the money, and then arose this combination
against the Guatemala stock, and it has fallen to a fourth
of its value in six months, and it takes heavy rowing&mdash;heavy.
I'd a great deal rather be in father's old place,
with an estate of five thousand dollars, and read my newspaper
in peace, than to have all I have with the misery of
managing it. I may work out and I may not."</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<p class="ph3">ACCEPTED AND ENGAGED.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">And</span> so at last I was accepted, and my engagement
with Eva was recognized as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>.</p>

<p>In the family of my betrothed were all shades
of acquiescence. Mrs. Van Arsdel was pensively resigned
to me as a mysterious dispensation of Providence. Mr.
Van Arsdel, though not in any way demonstrative, showed
an evident disposition to enter into confidential relations
with me. Ida was whole-hearted and cordial; and Alice,
after a little reconnoitering, joined our party as a gay,
generous young girl, naturally disposed to make the best
of things, and favorably inclined toward the interests of
young lovers.</p>

<p>Mr. Trollope, in <cite>The Small House at Allington</cite>, represents
a young man just engaged, as feeling himself in the awkward
position of a captive led out in triumph, for exhibition.
The lady and her friends are spoken of as marching him
forth with complacency, like a prize ox with ribbons in his
horns, unable to repress the exhibition of their delight in
having entrapped him. One would infer from this picture
of life such a scarcity of marriageable men that the capture
even of such game as young Crosbie, who is represented to
be an untitled young man, without fortune or principle, is
an occasion of triumph.</p>

<p>In our latitudes, we of the stronger sex are not taught to
regard ourselves as such overpoweringly delightful acquisitions,
and the declaration of an engagement is not with us
regarded as evidence of a lady's skill in hunting. I did not,
as young Crosbie is said to have done, feel myself somehow
<em>caught</em>. On the contrary, I was lost in wonder at my good
fortune. If I had found the pot of gold at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
rainbow, or dug up the buried treasures of Captain Kidd, I
could not have seemed to myself more as one who dreamed.</p>

<p>I wrote all about it to my mother, who, if she judged
by my letters, must have believed "Hesperian fables" true
for the first time in the world, and that a woman had been
specially made and created out of all impossible and fabulous
elements of joy. The child-wife of my early days,
the dream-wife of my youth, were both living, moving,
breathing in this wonderful reality. I tried to disguise
my good fortune&mdash;to walk soberly and behave myself
among men as if I were sensible and rational, and not
dazed and enchanted. I felt myself orbed in a magical
circle, out of which I looked pityingly on everybody that
was not <em>I</em>. A spirit of universal match-making benevolence
possessed me. I wanted everybody I liked to be
engaged. I pitied and made allowances for everybody that
was not. How could they be happy or good that had not
my fortune? They had not, they never could have, an
<em>Eva</em>. There was but one Eva, and I had her!</p>

<p>I woke every morning with a strange, new thrill of joy.
Was it so? Was she still in this world, or had this impossible,
strange mirage of bliss risen like a mist and
floated heavenward? I trembled when I thought how frail
a thing human life is. Was it possible that she might die?
Was it possible that an accident in a railroad car, a waft of
drapery toward an evening lamp, a thoughtless false step,
a mistake in a doctor's prescription, might cause this
lovely life to break like a bubble, and be utterly gone, and
there be no more Eva, never, nevermore on earth? The
very intensity of love and hope suggested the possibility of
the dreadful tragedy that every moment underlies life;
that with every joy connects the possibility of a proportioned
pain. Surely love, if nothing else, inclines the soul
to feel its helplessness and be prayerful, to place its
treasures in a Father's hand.</p>

<p>Sometimes it seemed to me too much to hope for, that
she should live to be my wife; that the fabulous joy of
possession should ever be mine. Each morning I left my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
bunch of fresh violets with a greeting in it at her door, and
assured myself that the earth yet retained her, and all day
long I worked with the under-thought of the little boudoir
where I should meet her in the evening. Who says modern
New York life is prosaic? The everlasting poem of man
and woman is as fresh there at this hour as among the crocuses
and violets of Eden.</p>

<p>A graceful writer, in one of our late magazines, speaks of
the freedom which a young man feels when he has found
the mistress and queen of his life. He is bound to no other
service, he is anxious about no other smile or frown. I had
been approved and crowned by my Queen of Love and
Beauty. If <em>she</em> liked me, what matter about the rest?</p>

<p>It did not disturb me a particle to feel that I was submitted
to as a necessity, rather than courted as a blessing,
by her parents. I cared nothing for cold glances or indifferent
airs so long as my golden-haired Ariadne threw me
the clew by which I threaded the labyrinth, and gave me
the talisman by which to open the door. Once safe with
her in her little "Italy," the boudoir in which we first
learned to know each other, we laughed and chatted, making
ourselves a gay committee of observation on the whole
world besides. Was there anybody so fortunate as we?
and was there any end to our subject-matter for conversation?</p>

<p>"You have no idea, Harry," she said to me, the first evening
after our engagement had been declared, "what a
time we've been having with Aunt Maria! You know she
is mamma's oldest sister, and mamma is one of the gentle,
yielding sort, and Aunt Maria has always ruled and reigned
over us all. She really has a way of ordering mamma
about, and mamma I think is positively afraid of her. Not
that she's really ill-tempered, but she is one of the sort that
thinks it's a matter of course that she should govern the
world, and is perfectly astonished when she finds she can't.
I have never resisted her before, because I have been rather
lazy, and it's easier to give up than to fight; and besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
one remembers one's catechism, and doesn't want to rise up
against one's pastors and masters."</p>

<p>"But you thought you had come to a place where
amiability ceased to be a virtue?" said I.</p>

<p>"Exactly. Ida always said that people must have courage
to be disagreeable, or they couldn't be good for much;
and so I put on all my terrors, and actually bullied Aunt
Maria into submission."</p>

<p>"You must have been terrific," said I, laughing.</p>

<p>"Indeed, you ought to have seen me! I astonished myself.
I told her that she always had domineered over us all,
but that now the time had come that she must let my
mother alone, and not torment her; that, as for myself, I
was a woman and not a child, and that I should choose my
lot in life for myself, as I had a right to do. I assure you,
there was warm work for a little while, but I remained mistress
of the field."</p>

<p>"It was a revolutionary struggle," said I.</p>

<p>"Exactly,&mdash;a fight at the barricades; and as a result a
new government is declared. Mamma reigns in her own
house and I am her prime minister. On the whole I think
mamma is quite delighted to be protected in giving me my
own way, as she always has. Aunt Maria has shaken dreadful
warnings and threatenings at me, and exhausted a perfect
bead-roll of instances of girls that had married for
love and come to grief. You'd have thought that nothing
less than beggary and starvation was before us; and the
more I laughed the more solemn and awful she grew. She
didn't spare me. She gave me a sad character. I hadn't
been educated for anything, and I didn't know how to do
anything, and I was nothing of a housekeeper, and I had no
strength; in short, she made out such a picture of my incapacities
as may well make you tremble."</p>

<p>"I don't tremble in the least," said I. "I only wish we
could set up our establishment to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Aunt Maria told me that it was ungenerous of me to get
engaged to a man of no fortune, now when papa is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
struggling with these heavy embarrassments, and can't afford
the money to marry me, and set me up in the style he would
feel obliged to. You see, Aunt Maria is thinking of a wedding
twice as big as the Elmores, and a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trousseau</i> twice as
fine, and a brown-stone front palace twice as high and
long and broad as the Rivingtons; and twice as many
coupés and Park wagons and phaetons as Maria Rivington
is to have; and if papa is to get all this for me, it will be
the ruin of him, she says."</p>

<p>"And you told her that we didn't want any of them?"
said I.</p>

<p>"To be sure I did. I told her that we didn't want one
of these vulgar, noisy, showy, expensive weddings, and
that I didn't mean to send to Paris for my things. That a
young lady who respected herself was always supplied
with clothes good enough to be married with; that we
didn't want a brown stone palace, and could be very happy
without any carriage; and that there were plenty of cheap
little houses in unfashionable streets we could be very
happy in; that people who really cared for us would come
to see us, live where we would, and that those who didn't
care might keep away."</p>

<p>"Bravo, my queen! and you might tell her how Mad.
Récamier drew all the wit and fashion of Paris to her
little brick-floored rooms in the old Abbey. People will
always want to come where <em>you</em> are."</p>

<p>"I don't set up for a Récamier," she exclaimed, "but I do
say that where people have good times, and keep a bright
pleasant fireside, and are always glad to see friends, there
will always be friends to come; and <em>friends</em> are the ones
we want."</p>

<p>"Ah! we will show them how things can be done, won't
we?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we will. I always wanted a nice little house all
my own where I could show what I could do. I have quantities
of pet ideas of what a home should be, and I always
fancied I could make things lovely."</p>

<p>"If you couldn't, who could?" said I, enchanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>"See here," she added, "I have just begun to think what
we have to start with. All the pictures in this little room
are mine, bought with my own allowance; they are my very
own. Pictures, you know, are a great thing, they half furnish
a house. Then you know that six thousand dollars
that grandmamma left me! Besides, sir, only think, a whole
silver cream-pitcher and six tablespoons! Why Harry, I'm
an heiress in my own right, even if poor papa should come
to grief."</p>

<p>Something in this talk reminded me of the far-off childish
days when Susie and I made our play-houses under the old
butternut tree, and gathered in our stores of chestnuts and
walnuts and laid our grave plans for life as innocently
as two squirrels, and I laughed with a tear in my eye. I recounted
to her the little idyl, and said that it had been a
foreshadowing of her, and that perhaps my child angel
had guided me to her.</p>

<p>"Some day you shall take me up there, Harry, and show
me where you and she played together, and we will gather
strawberries and lilies and hear the bobolinks," she said.
"How little the world knows how cheap happiness is!"</p>

<p>"To those that know where to look for it," said I.</p>

<p>"I heard papa telling you that half the estates on which
good New England families live in comfort up there in the
country don't amount to more than five thousand dollars,
yet they live well, and they have all those lovely things
around them <em>free</em>. Here in this artificial city life people
struggle and suffer to get money for things they don't want
and don't need. Nobody wants these great parties, with
their candy pyramids and their artificial flowers and their
rush and crush that tire one to death, and yet they pay as
much for one as would keep one of those country houses
going for a year. I do wish we could live there!"</p>

<p>"I do too&mdash;with all my heart, but my work must lie
here. We must make what the French call an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Interior</i>
here in New York. I shall have to be within call of printers
and the slave of printers' devils, but in summer we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
will go up into the mountains and stay with my mother, and
have it all to ourselves."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Harry," said Eva after a pause, "I can see
that Sophie Elmore really does admire Sydney. I can't
help wondering how one can, but I see she does. Now don't
you hope she'll get engaged to him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do," said I, "I wan't all nice people to be
engaged if they have as good a time as we do. It's my
solution of the woman question."</p>

<p>"Well, do you know I managed my last interview with
Sydney with reference to that? I made what you would
call a split-shot in croquet to send him from me and to her."</p>

<p>"How did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't ask me to describe. There are ways of managing
these men that are incommunicable. One can play on
them as upon a piano, and I'll wager you a pair of gloves
that Sydney goes off after Sophie. She's too good for him,
but she likes him, and Sophie will make him a nice wife.
But only think of poor Aunt Maria! It will be the last
stroke that breaks the camel's back to have the Elmores
get Sydney."</p>

<p>"So long as he doesn't get you, I shall be delighted,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Now only think," she added, "this Spring I was drifting
into an engagement with that man just because I was
idle, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i>, and didn't know what to do next, and didn't
have force enough to keep saying 'No' to mamma and
Aunt Maria and all the rest of them."</p>

<p>"And what gave you force?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I couldn't help seeing that <em>somebody else</em> was
getting very prettily entangled, and I felt a sort of philosophic
interest in watching the process, and somehow&mdash;you
know&mdash;I was rather sorry for you."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, and I began to feel that anybody else would be
intolerable, and you know they say there must be somebody."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>"But me you could tolerate? Thank you, for so much."</p>

<p>"Yes, Harry, I think you are rather agreeable. I couldn't
fancy myself sitting a whole evening with Sydney as I do
with you. I always had to resort to whist and all sorts of
go-betweens to keep him entertained; and I couldn't fancy
that I ever should run to the window to see if he were
coming in the evening, or long for him to come back when
he was on a journey. I'm afraid I should long quite the
other way and want him to go journeys often. But Sophie
will do all these things. Poor man! somebody ought to,
for he wouldn't be a bit satisfied if his wife were not
devoted. I told him that, and told him that he needed a
woman capable of more devotion than I could feel and
flattered him up a little&mdash;poor fellow, he took to it so kindly!
And after a while I contrived to let fall a nice bit of a
compliment I had once heard about him from a lady, who I
remarked was usually a little fastidious, and hard to please,
and you ought to have seen how animated he looked! A
mouse in view of a bit of toasted cheese never was more
excited. I wouldn't tell him who it was, yet I sent him off
on such a track that he inevitably will find out. That's
what I call sending Sophie a ball to play on. You see if
they don't have a great wedding about the time we have
our little one!"</p>

<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> announcement of my engagement brought the
usual influx of congratulations by letter and in
person. Bolton was gravely delighted, shook my
hand paternally, and even promised to quit his hermit hole
and go with me to call upon the Van Arsdels.</p>

<p>As to Jim, he raised a notable breeze among the papers.</p>

<p>"Engaged!&mdash;<em>you</em>, sly dog, after all! Well! well! Let
your sentimental fellows alone for knowing what they're
about. All your sighing, and poetry, and friendship, and
disinterestedness and all that don't go for nothing. Up
to '<em>biz</em>' after all! Well, you've done a tolerably fair stroke!
Those Van Arsdel girls are good for a hundred thousand
down, and the rest will come in the will. Well, joy to
you my boy! Remember your old grandfather."</p>

<p>Now there was no sort of use in going into high heroics
with Jim, and I had to resign myself to being congratulated
as a successful fortune hunter, a thing against which
all my resolution and all my pride had always been directed.
I had every appearance of being caught in the
fact, and Jim was prepared to make the most of the
situation.</p>

<p>"I declare, Hal," he said, perching himself astride a chair,
"such things make a fellow feel solemn. We never know
when our turn may come. Nobody feels safe a minute; it's
you to-day and me to-morrow. I may be engaged before
the week is out&mdash;who knows!"</p>

<p>"If nothing worse than that happens to you, you needn't
be frightened," said I. "Better try your luck. I don't find
it bad to take at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, but think of the consequences, man! Wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
journey, bandboxes and parasols to look after; beefsteaks
and coffee for two; house rent and water taxes; marketing,
groceries; all coming down on you like a thousand
of brick! And then 'My dear, won't you see to this?'
and 'My dear, have you seen to that?' and 'My dear, what
makes you let it rain?' and 'My dear, how many times
must I tell you I don't like hot weather?' and 'My dear,
won't you just step out and get me the new moon and
seven stars to trim my bonnet?' That's what I call getting
a fellow into business! It's a solemn thing, Hal,
now I tell you, this getting married!"</p>

<p>"If it makes you solemn, Jim, I shall believe it," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, when is it to come off? When is the blissful
day?"</p>

<p>"No time fixed as yet," said I.</p>

<p>"Why not? You ought to drive things. Nothing under
heaven to wait for except to send to Paris for the folderols.
Well, I shall call up and congratulate. If Miss Alice there
would take me, there might be a pair of us. Wouldn't it be
jolly? I say, Hal, how did you get it off?"</p>

<p>"Get what off?"</p>

<p>"Why, the question."</p>

<p>"You'll have to draw on your imagination for that, Jim."</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Harry, I won't offer myself to a girl on
uncertainties. I'd pump like thunder first and find out
whether she'd have me or not."</p>

<p>"I fancy," said I, "that if you undertake that process
with Miss Alice, you'll have your match. I think she has
as many variations of yes and no as a French woman."</p>

<p>"She doesn't catch this child," said Jim, "though she's
<em>mag</em>. and no mistake. Soberly, she's one of the nicest girls
in New York&mdash;but Jim's time isn't come yet.</p>

<p>So now, Hal, don't disturb my mind with these trifles. I've

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>In my secret heart I began to wish that the embarrassments
that were hanging over the Van Arsdel fortunes
would culminate and come to a crisis one way or another,
so that our position might appear to the world
what it really was. Mr. Van Arsdel's communications to
me were so far confidential that I did not feel that I
could allude to the real state of things even with my
most intimate friends; so that while I was looked upon
from the outside as the prospective winner of an heiress,
Eva and I were making all our calculations for the future
on the footing of the strictest prudence and economy.
Everybody was looking for splendor and festivities;
we were enacting a secret pastoral, in which we forsook
the grandeurs of the world to wander forth hand in hand
in paths of simplicity and frugality.</p>

<p>A week after this I received a note from Caroline which
announced her arrival in the city, and I lost no time in
waiting on her and receiving her congratulations on my
good fortune. Eva and Ida Van Arsdel were prompt in
calling upon her, and the three struck up a friendship
which grew with that tropical rapidity and luxuriance
characteristic of the attachments of women. Ida and
Caroline become at once bosom friends.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," Eva commented to me, "because you and I
are together so much now that I was afraid Ida might feel
a little out in the cold; I have been her pet and stand-by.
The fact is, I'm like that chemical thing that dyers call a
mordant&mdash;something that has an affinity for two different
colors that have no affinity for each other. I'm just enough
like mamma and just enough like Ida to hold the two together.
They both tell me everything, and neither of them
can do without me."</p>

<p>"I can well believe that," said I, "it is an experience
in which I sympathize. But I am coming in now, like the
third power in a chemical combination, to draw you away
from both. I shouldn't think they'd like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it's the way of nature! Mamma left her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
mother for papa&mdash;but Ida!&mdash;I'm glad for her to have so
nice a friend step in just now&mdash;one that has all her peculiar
tastes and motives. I wish she could go to Paris
and study with Ida when she goes next year. Do you
know, Harry, I used to think you were engaged to this
cousin of yours? Why weren't you?"</p>

<p>"She never would have had me,&mdash;her heart was gone to
somebody else."</p>

<p>"Why isn't she married, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh! the course of true love, you know."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"She never made me her confidant," said I, evasively.</p>

<p>"Tell me who it was, at all events," demanded she.</p>

<p>"Bolton."</p>

<p>"What! that serious, elegant Bolton that you brought
to call on us the other night! We all liked him so much!
What can be the matter there? Why, I think he's superb,
and she's just the match for him. What broke it off?"</p>

<p>"You know I told you she never made me her confidant."</p>

<p>"Nor he, either?"</p>

<p>"Well," said I, feeling myself cornered, "I throw myself
on your mercy. It's another man's secret, and I ought not
to tell you, but if you ask me I certainly shall."</p>

<p>"Right or wrong?"</p>

<p>"Yes, fair Eve, just as Adam ate the apple, so beware!"</p>

<p>"I'm just dying to know, but if you really ought not
to tell me I won't tease for it; but I tell you what it is,
Harry, if I were you I should bring them together."</p>

<p>"Would you dare take the responsibility of bringing any
two together?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I should. I am a daring young woman."</p>

<p>"I have not your courage," said I, "but if it will do you
any good to know, Bolton is in a fair way to renew the acquaintance,
though he meant not to do it."</p>

<p>"You can tell me how that happened, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is at your service. Simply, the meeting was
effected as some others of fateful results have been,&mdash;in a
New York street-car."</p>

<p>"Aha!" she said, laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; he was traveling up Sixth Avenue the other night
when a drunken conductor was very rude to two ladies.
Bolton interfered, made the man behave himself, waited on
the ladies across the street to their door as somebody else
once did,&mdash;when, behold! a veil is raised, the light of the
lamp flashes, and one says 'Mr. Bolton!' and the other
'Miss Simmons!' and the romance is opened."</p>

<p>"How perfectly charming! Of course he'll call and see
her. He <em>must</em>, you know."</p>

<p>"That has proved the case in my experience."</p>

<p>"And all the rest will follow. They are made for each
other. Poor Ida, she won't have Caroline to go to Paris
with her!"</p>

<p>"No? I think she will. In fact I think it would be the
best thing Caroline could do."</p>

<p>"You do! You don't want them to be married?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I wouldn't say&mdash;in fact it's a case I
wouldn't for the world decide."</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens! Here's a mystery, an obstacle, an unknown
horror, and you can't tell me what it is, and I
must not ask. Why, this is perfectly dreadful! It isn't
anything against Bolton?"</p>

<p>"Bolton is the man I most love, most respect, most revere,"
I said.</p>

<p>"What can it be then?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we leave it to fate and the future," said I.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="upper-case">"Hal!</span> it's too confounded bad!" said Jim Fellows,
bursting into my room; "your apple cart's upset
for good. The Van Arsdels are blown to thunder.
The old one has failed for a million. Gone to smash
on that Lightning Railroad, and there you all are! Hang
it all, I'm sorry now!"</p>

<p>And to say the truth Jim's face did wear an air of as much
concern as his features were capable of. "Seems to me,"
he added, "you take it coolly."</p>

<p>"The fact is, Jim, I knew all about this the day I proposed.
I knew it must come, and I'm glad, since it had to
be, to have it over and be done with it. Mr. Van Arsdel
told me exactly what to expect when I engaged myself."</p>

<p>"And you and Miss Eva Van Arsdel are going to join
hands and play 'Babes in the Woods'?"</p>

<p>"No," said I, "we are going to play the interesting little
ballet of 'Man and Wife.' I am to work for her, and all
that I win is to be put into her hands."</p>

<p>"Hum! I fancy she'll find things on quite another scale
when it comes to your dividends."</p>

<p>"We're not at all afraid of that&mdash;you'll see."</p>

<p>"She's a trump&mdash;that girl!" said Jim; "now that's what
I call the right sort of thing. And there's Alice! Now, I
declare it's too confounded rough on Alice! Just as she's
come out and such a splendid girl too!"</p>

<p>At this moment the office boy brought up a note.</p>

<p>"From Eva," I said, opening it.</p>

<p>It ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Well, dearest, the storm has burst and nobody is killed yet. Papa
told mamma last night, and mamma told us this morning, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
are all agreed to be brave as possible and make it seem as light as we
can to papa. Dear papa! I know it was for us he struggled, it was for
us he was anxious, and we'll show him we can do very well. Come
down now. Mamma says she feels as if she could trust you as a son.
Isn't that kind?</p>

<p>
Your own Eva."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"I'm going right down to the house," said I.</p>

<p>"I declare," said Jim, "I want to do something, and one
doesn't know what. I say, I'll buy a bouquet for Alice,
and you just take it with my compliments." So saying Jim
ran down with me, crossed to a florist's cellar, and selected
the most extravagant of the floral treasures there.</p>

<p>"Hang it all!" he said, "I wouldn't send her such a one
when she was up in the world, but now a fellow wants
to do all he can, you know."</p>

<p>"Jim," said I, "you are not a mere smooth-water friend."</p>

<p>"Not I. 'Go for the under dog in the fight' is my principle,
so get along with you and stay as long as you like.
I can do your book notices; I know just the sort of thing
you would say, you know&mdash;do 'em up brown, so that you
wouldn't know my ideas from your own."</p>

<p>Arrived at the Van Arsdel house, I thought I could see
and feel the traces of a crisis, by that mysterious intimation
that fills the very air of a place where something has just
happened. The elegant colored servant who opened the
door wore an aspect of tender regret like an undertaker
at a funeral.</p>

<p>"Miss Eva was in her boudoir," he said, "but Miss Alice
hadn't come down." I sent up the bouquet with Mr. Fellows'
compliments, and made the best of my way to Eva.</p>

<p>She was in the pretty little nook in which we had had
our first long talk and which now she called <em>our</em> Italy.
I found her a little pale and serious, but on the whole in
cheerful spirits.</p>

<p>"It's about as bad as it can be," said she. "It seems papa
has made himself personally responsible for the Lightning
Railroad and borrowed money to put into it, and then there's
something or other about the stock he borrowed on running
down till it isn't worth anything. I don't understand a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
word of it, only I know that the upshot of it all is, papa is
going to give up all he has and begin over. This house and
furniture will be put into a broker's hands and advertised
for sale. All the pictures are going to Goupil's sale rooms
and will make quite a nice gallery."</p>

<p>"Except yours in this room," said I.</p>

<p>"Ah well! I thought we should keep these, but I find
papa is very sensitive about giving up everything that is
really his&mdash;and these are his in fact. I bought them with
his money. At all events, let them go. We won't care,
will we?"</p>

<p>"Not so long as we have each other," said I. "For my
part, though I'm sorry for you all, yet I bless the stroke
that brings you to me. You see we must make a new home at
once, you and I, isn't it so? Now, hear me; let us be married
in June, the month of months, and for our wedding
journey we'll go up to the mountains and see my mother.
It's perfectly lovely up there. Shall it be so?"</p>

<p>"As you will, Harry. And it will be all the better so,
because Ida is going to sail for Paris sooner than she anticipated."</p>

<p>"Why does Ida do that?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Ida has been the manager of papa's
foreign correspondence and written all the letters for three
years past, and papa has paid her a large salary, of which
she has spent scarcely anything. She has invested it to
make her studies with in Paris. She offered this to papa,
but he would not take it. He told her it was no more his
than the salary of any other of his clerks, and that if she
wouldn't make him very unhappy she would take it and
go to Paris; and by going immediately she could arrange
some of his foreign business. So you see she will stay to
see us married and then sail."</p>

<p>"We'll be married in the same church where we put up
the Easter crosses," said I.</p>

<p>"How little we dreamed it then," she said, "and that
reminds me, sir, where's my glove that you stole on that
occasion? You naughty boy, you thought nobody saw you,
but somebody did."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your glove," said I, "is safe and sound in my reliquary
along with sundry other treasures."</p>

<p>"You unprincipled creature! what are they? Confess."</p>

<p>"Well! a handkerchief."</p>

<p>"Wretched man! and besides?"</p>

<p>"Two hair pins, a faded rose, two beads that dropped
from your croquet suit, and a sleeve button. Then there is
a dry sprig of myrtle that you dropped, on, let me see, the
14th of April, when you were out at the Park in one of
those rustic arbors."</p>

<p>"And you were sitting glowering like an owl in an ivy
bush. I remember I saw you there."</p>

<p>We both found ourselves laughing very much louder than
circumstances seemed really to require, when Eva heard
her father's footstep and checked herself.</p>

<p>"There goes poor papa. Isn't it a shame that we laugh?
We ought to be sober, now, but for the life of me I can't.
I'm one of the imponderable elastic gases; you can't keep
me down."</p>

<p>"One may 'as well laugh as cry,' under all circumstances,"
said I.</p>

<p>"Better, a dozen times. But seriously and soberly, I
believe that even papa, now it's all over, feels relieved. It
was while he was struggling, fearing, dreading, afraid to
tell us, that he had the worst of it."</p>

<p>"Nothing is ever so bad as one's fears," said I. "There is
always some hope even at the bottom of Pandora's box."</p>

<p>"Sententious, Mr. Editor, but true. Now in illustration.
Last week Ida and I wrote to the boys at Cambridge all
about what we feared was coming, and this very morning
we had such nice manly letters from both of them. If we
hadn't been in trouble we never should have known half
what good fellows they are. Look here," she said, opening
a letter, "Tom says, 'Tell father that I can take care of
myself. I'm in my senior year and the rest of the course
isn't worth waiting for and I've had an opportunity to pitch
in with a surveying party on the Northern Railroad along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
with my chum. I shall work like sixty, and make myself so
essential that they can't do without me. And, you see, the
first that will be known of me I shall be one of the leading
surveyors of the day. So have no care for me.' And here's
a letter from Will which says, 'Why didn't father tell us
before? We've spent ever so much more than we needed,
but are going about financial retrenchments with a vengeance.
Last week I attended the boat race at Worcester
and sent an account of it to the <cite>Argus</cite>, written off-hand,
just for the fun of it. I got a prompt reply, wanting to
engage me to go on a reporting tour of all the great election
meetings for them. I'm to have thirty dollars a week and
all expenses paid; so you see I step into the press at once.
We shall sell our pictures and furniture to some freshies
that are coming in, and wind up matters so as not to come
on father for anything till he gets past these straits. Tell
mother not to worry, she shall be taken care of; she shall
have Tom and me both to work for her.'"</p>

<p>"They are splendid fellows!" said I, "and it is worth a
crisis to see how well they behave in it. Well, then," I
resumed, "our wedding day shall be fixed, say for the 14th
of June?"</p>

<p>"How very statistical! I'm sure I can't say, I've got
to talk with mamma and all the powers that be, and settle
my own head. Don't let's set a day yet; it soils the blue
line of the distance&mdash;nothing like those pearl tints. Our
drawing master used to tell us one definite touch would
spoil them."</p>

<p>"For the present, then, it is agreed that we are to be
married <em>generally</em> in the month of June?" said I.</p>

<p>"P. P.&mdash;Providence permitting," said she&mdash;"Providence,
meaning mamma, Ida, Aunt Maria, and all the rest."</p>

<p class="ph3">THE WEDDING AND THE TALK OVER THE PRAYER-BOOK.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> novels are to be considered true pictures of real
life we must believe that the fall from wealth to
poverty is a less serious evil in America than in
any other known quarter of the world.</p>

<p>In English novels the failure of a millionaire is represented
as bringing results much the same as the commission
of an infamous crime. Poor old Mr. Sedley fails and
forthwith all his acquaintances cut him; nobody calls on
his wife or knows her in the street; the family who have
all along been courting his daughter for their son and kissing
the ground at her feet, now command the son to break
with her, and turn him out of doors for marrying her.</p>

<p>In America it is quite otherwise. A man fails without
losing friends, neighbors, and the consideration of society.
He moves into a modest house, finds some means of honest
livelihood, and everybody calls on his wife as before.
Friends and neighbors as they have opportunity are glad
to stretch forth a helping hand, and a young fellow who
should break his engagement with the daughter at such
a crisis would simply be scouted as infamous.</p>

<p>Americans have been called worshipers of the almighty
dollar, and they certainly are not backward in that species
of devotion, but still these well-known facts show that our
worship is not, after all, so absolute as that of other quarters
of the world.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Arsdel commanded the respect and sympathy
of the influential men of New York. The inflexible honesty
and honor with which he gave up all things to his
creditors won sympathy, and there was a united effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
made to procure for him an appointment in the Custom
House, which would give him a comfortable income. In
short, by the time that my wedding-day arrived, the family
might be held as having fallen from wealth into competence.
The splendid establishment on Fifth Avenue was
to be sold. It was, in fact, already advertised, and our
wedding was to be the last act of the family drama in it.
After that we were to go to my mother's, in the mountains
of New Hampshire, and Mr. Van Arsdel's family
were to spend the summer at the old farm-homestead
where his aged parents yet kept house.</p>

<p>Our wedding preparations therefore went forward with
a good degree of geniality on the part of the family, and
with many demonstrations of sympathy and interest on
the part of friends and relations. A genuine love-marriage
always and everywhere evokes a sort of instinctive
warmth and sympathy. The most worldly are fond
of patronizing it as a delightful folly, and as Eva had
been one of the most popular girls of her set she was
flooded with presents.</p>

<p>And now the day of days was at hand, and for the last
time I went up the steps of the Van Arsdel mansion to
spend a last evening with Eva Van Arsdel.</p>

<p>She met me at the door of her boudoir: "Harry, here
you are! oh, I have no end of things to tell you!&mdash;the
door bell has been ringing all day, and a perfect storm
of presents. We have duplicates of all the things that
nobody can do without. I believe we have six pie-knives
and four sugar-sifters and three egg-boilers and three
china hens to sit on eggs, and a perfect meteoric shower
of salt-cellars. I couldn't even count them."</p>

<p>"Oh well! Salt is the symbol of hospitality," said I,
"so we can't have too many."</p>

<p>"And look here, Harry, the wedding-dress has come
home. Think of the unheard-of incomprehensible virtue
of Tullegig! I don't think she ever had a thing done in
time before in her life. Behold now!"</p>

<p>Sure enough! before me, arranged on a chair was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
misty and visionary pageant of vapory tulle and shimmering
satin.</p>

<p>"All this is Ida's gift. She insisted that she alone would
dress me for my wedding, and poor Tullegig actually has
outdone herself and worked over it with tears in her
eyes. Good soul! she has a heart behind all her finery,
and really seems to take to me especially, perhaps because
I've been such a model of patience in waiting at
her doors, and never scolded her for any of her tricks.
In fact, we girls have been as good as an annuity to
Tullegig; no wonder she mourns over us. Do you know,
Harry, the poor old thing actually kissed me!"</p>

<p>"I'm not in the least surprised at her wanting that
privilege," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, I felt rather tender toward her. I believe it's
Dr. Johnson or somebody else who says there are few
things, not purely evil, of which we can say without emotion,
'This is the last!' And Tullegig is by no means a
pure evil. This is probably the last of her&mdash;with me. But
come, you don't say what you think of it. What is it
like?"</p>

<p>"Like a vision, like the clouds of morning, like the translation
robes of saints, like impossible undreamed mysteries
of bliss. I feel as if they might all dissolve away and be
gone before to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, shocking, Harry! you mustn't take such indefinite
cloudy views of things. You must learn to appreciate details.
Open your eyes, and learn now that Tullegig out of
special love and grace has adorned my dress with a new
style of trimming that not one of the girls has ever had
or seen before. It is an original composition of her own.
Isn't it blissful, now?"</p>

<p>"Extremely blissful," said I, obediently.</p>

<p>"You don't admire,&mdash;you are not half awake."</p>

<p>"I do admire&mdash;wonder&mdash;adore&mdash;anything else that you
like&mdash;but I can't help feeling that it is all a vision, and
that when those cloud wreaths float around you, you will
dissolve away and be gone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poh! poh! You will find me very visible and present,
as a sharp little thorn in your side. Now, see, here are the
slippers!" and therewith she set down before me a pair of
pert little delicious white satin absurdities, with high heels
and tiny toes, and great bows glistening with bugles.</p>

<p>Nothing fascinates a man like a woman's slipper, from its
utter incomprehensibility, its astonishing unlikeness to any
article subserving the same purpose for his own sex. Eva's
slippers always seemed to have a character of their own,&mdash;a
prankish elfin grace, and these as they stood there seemed
instinct with life as two white kittens just ready for a
spring.</p>

<p>I put two fingers into each of the little wretches and
made them caper and dance, and we laughed gayly.</p>

<p>"Let me see your boots, Harry?"</p>

<p>"There," said I, putting best foot forward, a brand new
pair bought for the occasion. "I am wearing them to get
used to them, so as to give my whole mind to the solemn
services to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, you enormous creature!" she said, "you are a perfect
behemoth. Fancy now my slippers peeping over the
table here and wondering at your boots. I can imagine the
woman question discussed between the slippers and the
boots."</p>

<p>"And I can fancy," said I, "the poor, stumping, well-meaning
old boots being utterly perplexed and routed by
the elfin slippers. What can poor boots do? They cannot
follow them, cannot catch or control them, and if they come
down hard on them they ruin them altogether."</p>

<p>"And the good old boots nevertheless," said she, "are
worth forty pairs of slippers. They can stamp through
wet and mud and rain, and come out afterward good as
new; and lift the slippers over impossible places. Dear
old patient long-suffering boots, let the slippers respect
them! But come, Harry, this is the last evening now,
and do you know I've some anxiety about our little programme
to-morrow? You were not bred in the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
and you never were married before, and so you ought
to be well up in your part beforehand."</p>

<p>"I confess," said I, "I feel ignorant and a bit nervous."</p>

<p>"Now, I've been a bridesmaid no end of times, and seen
all the possibles that may happen under those interesting
circumstances, and men are so awkward&mdash;their great feet
are always sure to step somewhere where they shouldn't,
and then they thumb and fumble about the ring, and their
gloves always stick to their hands, and it's uncomfortable
generally. Now don't, I beg you, disgrace me by any such
enormities."</p>

<p>"This is what the slippers say to the boots," said I.</p>

<p>"Exactly. And here is where the boots do well to take
a lesson of the slippers. They are 'on their native heath,'
here."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said I, "get down the Prayer-book and
teach me my proprieties. I will learn my lesson thoroughly."</p>

<p>"Well, now, we have the thing all arranged for to-morrow;
the carriages are to be here at ten; ceremony
at eleven. The procession will form at the church door;
first, Jim Fellows and Alice, then you and mamma, then
papa and me, and when we meet at the altar be sure to
mind where you step, and don't tread on my veil or any
of my tulle clouds, because, though it may look like vapor,
you can't very well set your foot through it; and
be sure you have a well-disciplined glove that you can
slip off without a fuss; and have the ring just where
you can lay your hand on it. And now let's read over
the service and responses and all that."</p>

<p>We went through them creditably till Eva, putting her
finger on one word, looked me straight in the eye.</p>

<p>"<em>Obey</em>, Harry, isn't that a droll word between you and
me? I can't conceive of it. Now up to this time you
have always obeyed me."</p>

<p>"And 'turn about, is fair play,' the proverb says," said
I, "you see, Eva, since Adam took the apple from Eve
men have obeyed women <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nem. con.</i>&mdash;there was no need
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
of putting the 'obey' into their part. The only puzzle is
how to constrain the subtle, imponderable, ethereal essence
of womanhood under some law; so the <em>obey</em> is our
helpless attempt."</p>

<p>"But now, really and truly, Harry, I want to talk seriously
about this. The girls are so foolish! Jane Seymour
said she said 'be gay' instead of 'obey'&mdash;and Maria Elmore
said she didn't say it at all. But really and truly, that is God's
altar&mdash;and it is a religious service, and if I go there at all,
I must understand what I mean, and say it from my heart."</p>

<p>"My dear, if you have any hesitancy you know that you
can leave it out. In various modern wedding services it is
often omitted. We could easily avoid it."</p>

<p>"Oh nonsense, Harry! Marry out of the Church! What
are you thinking of? Not I, indeed! I shouldn't think
myself really married."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my princess, it is your own affair. If you
choose to promise to obey me, I can only be grateful for
the honor; if it gives any power, it is of your giving, not
my seeking."</p>

<p>"But what does a woman promise when she promises at
the altar to obey?"</p>

<p>"Well, evidently, she promises to obey her husband in
every case where he commands, and a higher duty to God
does not forbid."</p>

<p>"But does this mean that all through life in every case
where there arises a difference of opinion or taste between
a husband and wife she is to give up to him?"</p>

<p>"If," said I, "she has been so unwise as to make this
promise to a man without common sense or gentlemanly
honor, who chooses to have his own will prevail in all
cases of differences of taste, I don't see but she must."</p>

<p>"But between people like you and me, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Between people like you and me, darling, I can't see
that the word can make any earthly difference. There
can be no obeying where there never is any commanding,
and as to commanding you I should as soon think
of commanding the sun and moon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well; but you know we shall not always think alike or
want the same thing."</p>

<p>"Then we will talk matters over, and the one that gives
the best reasons shall prevail. You and I will be like any
other two dear friends who agree to carry on any enterprise
together, we shall discuss matters, and sometimes one
and sometimes the other will prevail."</p>

<p>"But, Harry, this matter puzzles me. Why is there a
command in the Bible that wives should always obey?
Very many times in domestic affairs, certainly, the woman
knows the most and has altogether the best judgment."</p>

<p>"It appears to me that it is one of those very general
precepts that require to be largely interpreted by common
sense. Taking the whole race of man together, for
all stages of society and all degrees of development, I
suppose it is the safest general direction for the weaker
party. In low stages of society where brute force rules,
man has woman wholly in his power, and she can win
peace and protection only by submission. But where society
rises into those higher forms where husbands and
wives are intelligent companions and equals, the direction
does no harm because it confers a prerogative that
no cultivated man would think of asserting any more
than he would think of using his superior physical strength
to enforce it."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Eva, "it is just like the command that
children should obey parents. When children are grown
up and married and settled, parents never think of it."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said I, "and you and I are the grown-up
children of the Christian era&mdash;all that talk of obedience
is the old calyx of the perfect flower of love&mdash;'when
that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part
shall be done away.'"</p>

<p>"So, then, it appears you and I shall have a free field
of discussion, Harry, and may be I shall croquet your ball
off the ground sometimes, as I did once before, you know."</p>

<p>"I dare say you will. There was an incipient spice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
matrimonial virulence, my fair Eva, in the way you played
that game! In fact, I began to hope I was not indifferent
to you from the zeal with which you pursued and routed
me on that occasion."</p>

<p>"I must confess it did my heart good to set your ball
spinning,&mdash;and that puts me in mind. I have the greatest
piece of news to tell you. If you'll believe me, <em>Sydney and
Sophie are engaged already!</em>She came here this morning
with her present, this lovely amethyst cross&mdash;and it seems
funny to me, but she is just as dead in love with Sydney as
she can be, and do you know he is so delighted with the
compliment, that he has informed her that he has made the
discovery that he <em>never was in love before</em>."</p>

<p>"The scamp! what does he mean?" said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, he said that little witch Eva Van Arsdel had dazzled
him&mdash;and he had really supposed himself in love, but
that she never had 'excited the profound,' etc., etc., he feels
for Sophie."</p>

<p>"So 'all's well that ends well,'" said I.</p>

<p>"And to show his entire pacification toward me," said
Eva, "he has sent me this whole set of mantel bronzes&mdash;clock,
vases, candlesticks, match-box and all. Aren't they
superb?"</p>

<p>"Magnificent!" said I. "What an air they will give our
room! On the whole, dear, I think rejected lovers are not
so bad an article."</p>

<p>"Well, here, I must show you Bolton's present, which
came in this afternoon," with which she led me to a pair
of elegantly carved book-racks enriched with the complete
works of Longfellow, Whittier, Lowell, Holmes, and Hawthorne.
They were elegantly gotten up in a uniform style
of binding.</p>

<p>"Isn't that lovely?" said she, "and so thoughtful! For
how many happy hours he has provided here!"</p>

<p>"Good fellow!" said I, feeling the tears start in my eyes.
"Eva, if there is a mortal absolutely without selfishness, it
is Bolton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, why couldn't he marry and be as happy
as we are?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps some day he may," said I, "but dear me! who
gave that comical bronze inkstand? It's enough to make
one laugh to look at it."</p>

<p>"Don't you know at once? Why, that's Jim Fellows'
present. Isn't it just like him?"</p>

<p>"I might have known it was Jim," said I, "it's so decidedly
frisky."</p>

<p>"Well, really, Harry do you know that I am in deadly
fear that that wicked Jim will catch my eye to-morrow
in the ceremony or do something to set me off, and I'm
always perfectly hysterical when I'm excited, and if I
look his way there'll be no hope for me."</p>

<p>"We must trust to Providence," said I; "if I should
say a word of remonstrance it would make it ten times
worse. The creature is possessed of a frisky spirit and
can't help it."</p>

<p>"Alice was lecturing him about it last night, and the
only result was we nearly killed ourselves laughing. After
all, Harry, who can help liking Jim? Since our troubles
he has been the kindest of mortals; so really delicate and
thoughtful in his attentions. It was something I shouldn't
have expected of him. Harry, what do you think? Should
you want Alice to like him, supposing you knew that he
would like her? Is there stability enough in him?"</p>

<p>"Jim is a queer fellow," said I. "On a slight view he
looks a mere bundle of comicalities and caprices, and he
takes a singular delight in shocking respectable prejudices
and making himself out worse than he is, or ever thinks of
being. But after all, as young men go, Jim is quite free
from bad habits. He does not drink, and he doesn't even
smoke. He is the most faithful assiduous worker in his
line of work among the newspaper-men of New York. He
is a good son; a kind brother."</p>

<p>"But, somehow, he doesn't seem to me to have real deep
firm principle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jim is a child of modern New York&mdash;an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élève</i> of her
school. A good wife and a good home, with good friends,
might do much for him, but he will always be one that will
act more from kindly impulses than from principle. He
will be very apt to go as his friends go."</p>

<p>"You know," she said, "in old times, when Alice was
in full career, I never thought of anything serious as possible.
It is only since our trouble and his great kindness
to us that I have thought of the thing as at all likely."</p>

<p>"We may as well leave it to the good powers," said I,
"we can't do much to help or hinder, only, if they should
come together I shall be glad for Jim's sake, for I love
him. And now, my dear Eva, have you any more orders,
counsels, or commands for the fateful to-morrow?" said I,
"for it waxes late, and you ought to get a beauty-sleep
to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you I'm not going to wear either my
new traveling dress or hat, or anything to mark me out as a
bride; and look here, Harry, you must try and study the old
staid married man's demeanor. Don't let's disgrace ourselves
by being discovered at once."</p>

<p>"Shall I turn my back on you and read the newspaper?
I observe that some married men do that."</p>

<p>"Yes, and if you could conjugally wipe your boots on my
dress, it would have an extremely old married effect. You
can read the paper <em>first</em>, and then pass it to me&mdash;that is another
delicate little point."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that in your zeal you will drive me to excesses
of boorishness that will overshoot the mark" said I.
"You wouldn't want me to be so negligent of 'that pretty
girl,' that some other gentleman would feel a disposition to
befriend her?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, but there's a happy medium. We can appear
like two relatives traveling together."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," said I "after all, we shall be detected; but
if we are, we shall be in good company. Our first day's
journey lies in the regular bridal route, and I expect that
every third or fourth seat will show an enraptured pair, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
whom we can take lessons&mdash;after all, dear, you know there
is no sin in being just married."</p>

<p>"No, only in acting silly about it as I hope we shan't. I
want us to be models of rationality and decorum."</p>

<p>Here the clock striking twelve warned me that the last
day of Eva Van Arsdel's life was numbered.</p>

<p class="ph3">BOLTON.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I returned</span> to my room past midnight, excited
and wakeful. Seeing a light through the crack of
Bolton's door, I went up and knocked and was bidden
to enter. I found him seated under his study-lamp,
looking over a portfolio of papers, some of which lay strewed
around him open. I observed at a glance that the hand-writing
was that of Caroline. He looked at me. Our eyes
met&mdash;a slight flush rose in his cheeks as he said:</p>

<p>"I have been looking over a collection of writings belonging
to your cousin, the fruits of the solitary years of her
secluded life."</p>

<p>"And you find them&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"A literary treasure," he said, with emphasis. "Yes," he
added, "what there is here will, I think, give her reputation
and established position, and a command of prices which
will enable her to fullfil her long cherished intention of
studying in Paris. She will go out with Miss Ida Van
Arsdel, soon after you are gone. I can assure her the means,
and I have already procured her the situation of correspondent
to the <cite>Chronicle</cite>, with very liberal terms. So you
see her way is all plain."</p>

<p>"But what shall we do with the <cite>Ladies' Cabinet?</cite>"</p>

<p>"O, we'll manage it among us. Caroline will write for it
occasionally."</p>

<p>"<em>Caroline!</em>" There was a great deal in the manner in
which Bolton spoke that name. It was full of suppressed
feeling. Some can express as much intensity of devotion by
the mere utterance of a name, as others by the most ardent
protestations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>I was in the mood that holds every young man on the eve
of a happy marriage. I could conceive of no bliss outside
of that; and there was in the sound of Bolton's voice, as he
spoke, a vibration of an intense pain which distressed me.</p>

<p>"Bolton," I said, imploringly, "why will you sacrifice
yourself and her? She loves you&mdash;you love her. Why not
another marriage&mdash;another home?"</p>

<p>His face quivered a moment, and then settled firmly. He
smiled.</p>

<p>"Hal, my boy," he said, "you naturally see nothing for
man and woman but marriage just now. But it is not every
man and woman who love each other who have the <em>right</em> to
marry. She does love me," he added, with a deep, inward
breathing. "She is capable of all that magnanimity, all
that generous self-sacrifice that make women such angels
to us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, oh! why not&mdash;&mdash;?" began I, eagerly.</p>

<p>"<em>Because</em> I <span class="smcap">LOVE</span> her dearly, devotedly, I will not accept
such a sacrifice. I will not risk her wrecking her life on
me. The pain she feels now in leaving me will soon die out
in the enthusiasm of a career. Yes, the day is now come,
thank God, when a woman as well as a man can have some
other career besides that of the heart. Let her study her
profession&mdash;expand her mind, broaden her powers&mdash;become
all that she can be. It will not impede her course to remember
that there is in the world one friend who will always
love her above all things; and the knowledge that she loves
me will save me&mdash;if I am salvable."</p>

<p>"<em>If</em>&mdash;oh, Bolton, my brother! <em>why</em> do you say <em>if?</em>"</p>

<p>"Because the danger is one I cannot comprehend and provide
for. It is like that of sudden insanity. The curse may
never return&mdash;pray God it may not&mdash;but if it should, at
least I shall wreck no other heart."</p>

<p>"Bolton, can you say so if there is one that loves you?"</p>

<p>"Not as a wife would love. Her whole being and destiny
are not intertwined with mine, as marriage would unite
them. Besides, if there is somewhere hid away in my brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
and blood the seed of this fatal mania, shall I risk transmitting
them to a helpless child? Shall I expose such a
woman to the danger of suffering over again, as a mother,
the anguish she must suffer as a wife?&mdash;the fears, the anxieties,
the disappointment, the wearing, wasting pain? As
God is my Judge, I will not make another woman suffer
what my mother has."</p>

<p>In all my intercourse with Bolton, I never heard him speak
of his mother before, and he spoke now with intense vehemence;
his voice vibrated and quivered with emotion. In
a few moments, however, he resumed his habitual self-possession.</p>

<p>"No, Hal," he said, cheerily; "build no air-castles for me.
I shall do well enough; you and yours will be enough to
occupy me. And now show me first what I am to do for you
while you are gone. Jim and I will trudge to all impossible
places, to look you up that little house with a good many
large rooms in it, that all young housekeepers are in search
of. I will cut out advertisements and look over nice places
and let you know the result; and I'll see to the proof-sheets
of your articles for the <cite>Milky Way</cite>, and write your contributions
to the <cite>Democracy</cite>. If you want to be our special correspondent
from the Garden of Eden, why you may send us
back letters on your trip. You can tell us if the 'gold of
that land' is still 'good,' and if there are there still 'bdellium
and onyx stone,' as there were in the Bible days."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I. "I shall send you letters, but hardly
of a kind to appear in the <cite>Democracy</cite>."</p>

<p>"What with your engagements on that sheet, and
what I shall have ready to pile in on you by the time you
come back, you will have little time for philandering after
your return. So take it out now and get all the honey there
is in this next moon. For me, I have my domestic joys.
Finnette has presented me with a charming batch of kittens.
Look here."</p>

<p>And sure enough, snugly ensconced in a large, well-padded
basket by the fire, lay madam asleep, with four downy little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
minikins snuggled to her. Bolton took the lamp and
kneeled down to show them, with the most absorbed intent.
Stumpy came and stood by the basket, wagging what was
left of his poor tail, and looking as if he had some earnest
responsibility in the case.</p>

<p>As to Finnette, she opened her yellow eyes, sleepily
stretched out her claws, purred and rolled over, as if in excess
of pride and joy.</p>

<p>"Who says there isn't happiness on earth?" said Bolton.
"A cat is a happiness-producing machine. Hal, I shall save
one of those kittens to set you up with. No family is complete
without a cat. I shall take one in training for you.
You should have a dog, too; but I can't spare Stumpy. I
don't believe there is anything like him in the world."</p>

<p>"I verily believe you," said I.</p>

<p>"Stumpy's beauty is so entirely moral that I fear it never
would be popularly appreciated; besides, poor brute, he is
quite capable of dying for love of me if I gave him up.
That's an accomplishment few men attain to. Well, Hal,
go to bed now, or you'll be too sleepy to behave respectably
to-morrow. God bless you!"</p>

<p class="ph3">THE WEDDING JOURNEY.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A wedding</span> journey,&mdash;what is it? A tour to all
the most expensive and fashionable hotels and
watering-places. The care of Saratoga trunks
and bonnet-boxes. The display of a fashionable wardrobe
made purposely for this object, and affording three altogether
new and different toilets a day.</p>

<p>Very well.</p>

<p>Doubtless all this may coexist with true love; and true
lovers, many and ardent, have been this round, and may
again, and been and be none the worse for it. For where
true love is, it is not much matter whatever else is or is not.</p>

<p>But when the Saratoga trunks, the three dresses a day,
and the display of them to Mrs. Grundy, have been the
substitute for love and one of the impelling motives to
marriage, or when they absorb all those means and resources
on which domestic comfort and peace should be
built during the first years of married life, then they are
simply in Scriptural phrase "the abomination of desolation,
standing where it ought not."</p>

<p>Yet apart from that there is to me a violation of the
essential sacredness of the holiest portion of mortal life in
exposing it to the glare of everyday observation. It seems
as if there were something so wonderful and sacred in that
union by which man and woman, forsaking all others, cleave
to each other, that its inception requires quiet solitude, the
withdrawal from the common-place and bustling ways of
ordinary life.</p>

<p>The two, more to each other than all the world besides,
are best left to the companionship of nature. Carpets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
moss are better than the most elaborate of fashionable hotel
furniture; birds and squirrels are more suitable companions
than men and women.</p>

<p>Our wedding was a success, so far as cheerfulness and
enjoyment was concerned. The church had been garlanded
and made fair and sweet by the floral tributes of many
friendly hands. Jim Fellows and one or two of the other
acquaintances of the family had exerted themselves to
produce a very pretty effect. The wedding party was one
of relatives and near friends only, without show or parade,
but with a great deal of good taste. There was the usual
amount of weeping among the elderly female relatives,
particularly on the part of Aunt Maria, who insisted on
maintaining a purely sepulchral view of our prospects on
life.</p>

<p>Ever since the failure of Mr. Van Arsdel, Aunt Maria had
worn this aspect, and seemed to consider all demonstrations
of lightness of heart and cheerfulness on the part of
the family as unsuitable trifling with a dreadful dispensation.</p>

<p>But the presence of this funereal influence could not
destroy the gayety of the younger members, and Jim Fellows
seemed to exert himself particularly to whip up such
a froth and foam of merriment and jollity as caused the
day to be remembered as one of the gayest in our annals.</p>

<p>We had but one day's ride in the cars to bring us up to
the old simple stage route of the mountain country. During
this said day in the cars, under the tutelage of my
Empress, I was made to behave myself with the grimmest
and most stately reserve of manner. Scarcely was I allowed
the same seat with her, and my conversation with her, so
far as could be observed, was confined to the most unimpassioned
and didactic topics.</p>

<p>The reason for this appeared to be that having married
in the very matrimonial month of June, and our track lying
along one of the great routes of fashionable travel, we
were beset behind and before by enraptured couples, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
amiable artlessness in the display of their emotions appeared
particularly shocking to her taste. On the row of seats
in front of us could be seen now a masculine head lolling
confidentially on a feminine shoulder, and again in the next
seat an evident bridal bonnet leaning on the bosom of the
beloved waistcoat of its choice in sweet security.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly disgusting and disagreeable," she said
in my ear.</p>

<p>"My dear," I replied, "I don't see as we can do anything
about it."</p>

<p>"I don't see&mdash;I cannot imagine how people can make
such a show of themselves," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said I, "we are all among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenus</i>
of married life. It isn't everybody that knows how to
behave as if he had always been rich&mdash;let us comfort ourselves
with reflections on our own superiority."</p>

<p>The close of the day brought us, however, to the verge of
the mountain region where railroads cease and stages begin,&mdash;the
beautiful country, of hard, flinty, rocky roads, of
pines and evergreens of silvery cascades and brooks of
melted crystal, and of a society, as yet homely and heart-some,
and with a certain degree of sylvan innocence. At
once we seemed to have left the artificial world behind
us&mdash;the world of observers and observed. We sat together
on the top of the stage, and sailed like two birds of the
air through the tree-tops of the forest, looking down into
all the charming secrets of woodland ways as we went
on, and feeling ourselves delivered from all the spells and
incantations of artificial life. We might have been two
squirrels, or a pair of robins, or blue birds. We ceased to
think how we appeared. We forgot that there were an
outer world and spectators, and felt ourselves taken in and
made at home in the wide hospitality of nature. Highland,
where my mother lived, was just within a day's ride
of the finest part of the White Mountains. The close of a
charming leisurely drive upward brought us at night to
her home, and I saw her sweet face of welcome at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
door to meet us, and gave her new daughter to her arms
with confident pride.</p>

<p>The village was so calm, and still, and unchanged!
The old church where my father had preached, the houses
where still lived the people I had known from a boy, the
old store, the tavern with its creaking sign-post, and best
of all, Uncle Jacob's house, with its recesses and corners
full of books, its quiet rooms full of comfort, its traditions
of hospitality, and the deep sense of calm and rest that
seemed ever brooding there. This was a paradise where
I could bring my Eve for rest and for refuge.</p>

<p>What charming days went over our heads there! We
rambled like two school children, hand in hand, over all the
haunts of my boyhood. Where I and my little child-wife
had gathered golden-hearted lilies, and strawberries, we
gathered them again. The same bobolink seemed to sit on
the top twig of the old apple tree in the corner of the
meadow and say "Chack, chack, chack!" as he said it when
Susie and I used to sit with the meadow grass over our
heads to watch him while he poured down on us showers
of musical dew drops. It seemed as if I had gone back to
boyhood again, so much did my inseparable companion
recall to me the child-wife of my early days. We were
both such perfect children, living in the enjoyment of
the bright present, without a care or a fear for the future.</p>

<p>Every day when we returned from our rambles and excursions
the benignant face of my mother shone down on
us with fullness of appreciation and joy in our joy; while
Uncle Jacob, still dry, quizzical, and active as ever, regarded
us with an undisguised complacency.</p>

<p>"You've done the right thing now, Harry," he said to
me. "She'll <em>do</em>. You're a lucky boy to get such a one,
even though she is a city girl."</p>

<p>Eva, after a little experience in mountain climbing, proceeded
to equip herself for it with feminine skill. Our
village store supplied her with material out of which with
wonderful quickness she constructed what she called a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
mountain suit, somewhat of the bloomer order, but to
which she contrived to impart a sort of air of dapper grace
and fitness. And once arrayed in this she climbed with me
to the most impossible places, and we investigated the innermost
mysteries of rock, forest, and cavern.</p>

<p>My uncle lent me his horse and carriage, and with a
luncheon-basket well stored by my mother's providing care,
we went on a tour of exploration of two or three days
into the mountains, in the course of which we made ourselves
familiar in a leisurely manner with some of the
finest scenery.</p>

<p>The mutual acquaintance that comes to companions in
this solitude and face-to-face communion with nature, is
deeper and more radical than can come when surrounded
by the factitious circumstances of society. When the
whole artificial world is withdrawn, and far out of sight,
when we are surrounded with the pure and beautiful
mysteries of nature, the very best and most genuine
part of us comes to the surface, we know each other by
the communion of our very highest faculties.</p>

<p>When Eva and I found ourselves alone together in the
heart of some primeval forest, where the foot sunk ankle-deep
in a carpet of more exquisite fabric than any loom
of mortal workmanship could create, where the old fallen
trunks of trees were all overgrown with this exquisite
mossy tapestry, and all around us was a perfect broidery
and inlay of flower and leaf, while birds called to us
overhead, down through the flickering shadows of the
pine boughs, we felt ourselves out of the world and in
paradise, and able to look back from its green depths with
a dispassionate judgment on the life we had left.</p>

<p>Then, the venture we had made in striking hands with
each other to live, not for the pomps and vanities of this
world, but for the true realities of the heart, seemed to us
the highest reason. Nature smiled on it. Every genuine
green thing, every spicy fragrant bush and tree, every
warbling bird, true to the laws of its nature, seemed to
say to us "Well done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose," said Eva, as we sat in one of these mountain
recesses whence we could gain a view of the little
silvery cascade, "I suppose that there are a great many
people who look on me as a proper subject of pity. My
father has failed. I have married a man with no fortune,
except what he has in himself. We can't afford to spend
our honeymoon at Niagara, Saratoga, and the rest of the
show places; and we don't contemplate either going to
parties or giving them when we go back to New York."</p>

<p>"Poor, poor Eva Van Arsdel! how art thou fallen!"
said I.</p>

<p>"Poor Aunt Maria!" said Eva. "I honestly and truly am
sorry for her. She really loves me in her way&mdash;the way
most people love you, which is to want you to be happy in
doing as <em>they</em> please. Her heart was set on my making an
astoundingly rich match, and having a wedding that
should eclipse all former weddings, and then becoming
a leader of fashionable society; and to have me fail of
all this is a dreadful catastrophe. I want somehow to
comfort her and make up with her, but she can't forgive
me. She kissed me at last with a stern and warning air
that seemed to say: 'Well, if you will go to destruction,
I can't help it.'"</p>

<p>"Perhaps when she sees how happy we are, she will get
over it," said I.</p>

<p>"No, I fear not. Aunt Maria can't conceive of anybody's
being happy that has to begin life with an ingrain
carpet on the floor. She would think it a positive indecorum
to be happy under such circumstances&mdash;a want of
a proper sense of the fitness of things. Now, I propose
to be very happy under precisely those circumstances, and
to try to make you so; consequently you see I shall offend
her moral sense continuously, and, as I said, I do wish it
weren't so, because I love Aunt Maria, and am sorry I
can't please her."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said I, "there is no making her comprehend
the resources we have in each other&mdash;our love of
just this bright, free, natural life?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh dear, no! All Aunt Maria's idea of visiting the
mountains would be having rooms at the Profile House
in the height of the season, and gazing in full dress at
the mountains from the verandahs. I don't think she
really cares enough for any thing here to risk wetting her
feet for it. I dare say the poor dear soul is lying awake
nights now, lamenting over my loss of what I don't care
for, and racking her brains how we may contrive to patch
up a little decent gentility."</p>

<p>"And you are as free and gay as an oriole!"</p>

<p>"Certainly I am. All I wish is that we could live in
one of these little mountain towns, just as your mother
and uncle do. I love the hearty, simple society here."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "as we cannot, we can only try to make
a home in New York, as simple-hearted, and kindly, and
unworldly as if we lived here."</p>

<p>"Yes, and we can do that," said she. "You have only
to resolve to be free, and you are free. Now, that is the
beauty of our being married. <em>Alone</em>, we are parts of
other families, drawn along with them&mdash;<em>entrained</em>, as the
French say: now we are married, we can do as we please;
we become king and queen of a new state. In our own house
we can have our own ways. We are monarchs of all
we survey."</p>

<p>"True," said I, "and a home and a family that has an
original and individual life of its own, is always recognized
in time as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait accompli</i>. You and I will be for the
future 'The Hendersons;' and people will say the Hendersons
do this and that, or the Hendersons don't do the
other. They will study us as one studies a new State."</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, taking up my idea in her vivacious
way, "and when they have ascertained our latitude and
longitude, soil and productions, manners and customs,
they can choose whether they like to visit us."</p>

<p>"And you are not in the least afraid of having it said,
'The Hendersons are odd?'" asked I.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," replied Eva, "so long as the oddity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
is some unusual form of comfort. For example, a sitting-room
like your uncle's, with its brass andirons and blazing
wood fire, its books and work, its motherly lounges, would
be a sort of exotic in New York, where people, as a matter
of course, expect a pier-glass and marble slab, a somber
concatenation of cord and tassels and damask curtains,
and a given number of French chairs and ottomans,
veiled with linen covers, and a general funereal darkness
of gentility. Now, I propose to introduce the country sitting
room into our New York house. Your mother already
has given me her wedding andirons&mdash;perfect loves&mdash;with
shovel and tongs corresponding; and I am going to have
a bright, light, free and easy room which the sunshine shall
glorify."</p>

<p>"But you know, my love, wood is very dear in New
York."</p>

<p>"So are curtains, and ottomans, and mirrors, and marble
slabs, and quantities of things which we shall do without.
And then, you see, we don't propose to <em>warm</em> our house
with a wood-fire, but only to adorn it. It is an altar fire
that we will kindle every evening, just to light up our
room and show it to advantage. How charming every
thing looks at your mother's in that time between daylight
and dark, when you all sit round the hearth, and the
fire lights up the pictures and the books, and makes every
thing look so dreamy and beautiful!"</p>

<p>"You are a little poet, my dear; it will be your specialty
to turn life into poetry."</p>

<p>"And that is what I call woman's genius. To make life
beautiful; to keep down and out of sight the hard, dry,
prosaic side, and keep up the poetry&mdash;that is my idea of
our 'mission.' I think woman ought to be, what Hawthorne
calls, 'The Artist of the Beautiful.'"</p>

<p class="ph3">MY WIFE'S WARDROBE.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_l.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="L" title="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Let</span>
not the reader imagine by the paragraph on
Saratoga trunks that my little wife had done
what the Scripture assumes is the impossibility
for womankind, and as a bride forgotten her attire.</p>

<p>Although possessing ideas of great moderation, she had
not come to our mountain home without the appropriate
armor of womanhood.</p>

<p>I interpreted the duties of a husband after the directions
of Michelet, and was my wife's only maid, and in all
humility performed for her the office of packing and unpacking
her trunks, and handling all those strange and
wonderful mysteries of the toilet, which seemed to my eyes
penetrated with an ineffable enchantment.</p>

<p>I have been struck with dismay of late, in reading the
treatises of some very clever female reformers concerning
the dress of the diviner sex.</p>

<p>It is really in contemplation among them to reduce it
to a level as ordinary and prosaic as it occupies among
us men, heavy-footed sons of toil? Are sashes and bows,
and neck ribbons and tiny slippers and gloves to give
way to thick-soled boots and buckskin gauntlets and
broadcloth coats? To me my wife's wardrobe was a
daily poem, and from her use of it I derived the satisfaction
of faculties which had lain dormant under my heavy
black broadcloth, like the gauzy tissue under the black
horn wings of a poor beetle. I never looked at the splendid
pictures of Paul Veronese and Titian in the Venetian
galleries, without murmuring at the severe edicts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
of modern life which sends every man forth on the tide
of life, like a black gondola condemned to one unvarying
color. Those gorgeous velvets in all the hues of the
rainbow, those dainty laces and splendid gems, which
once were allowed to us men, are all swept away, and
for us there remains no poetry of dress. Our tailor turns
us out a suit in which one is just like another with scarce
an individual variation.</p>

<p>The wife, then, the part of one's self which marriage
gives us, affords us a gratification of these suppressed
faculties. She is our finer self; and in her we appreciate
and enjoy what is denied to us. I freely admit the
truth of what women-reformers tell us, that it is the admiration
of us men that stimulates the love of dress in
women. It is a fact&mdash;I confess it with tears in my eyes&mdash;but
it is the truth, that we are blindly enchanted by that
play of fancy and poetry in their externals, which is forever
denied to us; and that we look with our indulgent
eyes even on what the French statesman calls their "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fureurs
de toilette</i>."</p>

<p>In fact, woman's finery never looks to another woman as
it does to a man. It has to us a charm, a sacredness, that
they cannot comprehend.</p>

<p>Under my wife's instruction I became an expert guardian
of these filmy treasures of the wardrobe, and knew
how to fold and unfold, and bring her everything in its
place, as she daily performed for me the charming work
of making up her toilet. To be sure, my slowness and
clumsiness brought me many brisk little lectures, but my
good will and docility were so great that my small sovereign
declared herself on the whole satisfied with my progress.
There was a vapory collection apparently made up
of bits and ends of rainbows, flosses of clouds, spangles of
stars, butterflies and humming bird's wings, which she
turned and tossed over daily, with her dainty fingers,
selecting a bit here and a morsel there, which went to
her hair, or her neck, or her girdle, with a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
appropriateness, and in a manner to me wholly incomprehensible;
only the result was a new picture every
day. This little, artless tableau was expensive neither
of time nor money, and the result was a great deal of
very honest pleasure to us both. It was her pride to be
praised and admired first by me, and then by my mother,
and aunt, and uncle Jacob, who turned her round and admired
her, as if she had been some rare tropical flower.</p>

<p>Now, do the very alarmingly rational women-reformers
I speak of propose to forbid to women in the future all
the use of clothes except that which is best adapted to
purposes of work? Is the time at hand when the veil
and orange flowers and satin slippers of the bride shall
melt away into mist, and shall we behold at the altar the
union of young parties, dressed alike in swallow-tailed
coats and broadcloth pantaloons, with brass buttons?</p>

<p>If this picture seems absurd, then, it must be admitted
that there is a reason in nature why the dress of woman
should forever remain different from that of man, in the
same manner that the hand of her Creator has shaped her
delicate limbs and golden hair differently from the rugged
organization of man. Woman was meant to be more than
a worker; she was meant for the poet and artist of life;
she was meant to be the charmer; and that is the reason,
dear Miss Minerva, why to the end of time you cannot help
it that women always will, and must, give more care and
thought to dress than men.</p>

<p>To be sure, this runs into a thousand follies and extravagances;
but in this as in everything else the remedy
is not extirpation, but direction.</p>

<p>Certainly my pretty wife's pretty toilets had a success
in our limited circle, which might possibly have been
denied in fashionable society at Saratoga and Newport.
She was beauty, color, and life to our little world, and
followed by almost adoring eyes wherever she went. It
was as real an accession of light and joy to the simple
ways of our household to have her there, as a choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
picture, or a marvelous strain of music. My wife had
to perfection the truly artistic gift of dress. Had she
lived in Robinson Crusoe's island with no one to look
at her but the paroquets and the monkeys, and with no
mirror but a pool of water, she would have made a careful
toilet every day, from the mere love of beauty; and
it was delightful to see how a fresh, young, charming
woman, by this faculty of adornment, seemed to make
the whole of the sober, old house like a picture or a
poem.</p>

<p>"She is like the blossom on a cactus," said my Uncle
Jacob. "We have come to our flower, in her; we have it
in us; we all like it, but she brings it out; she is our blossom."</p>

<p>In fact, it was charming to see the delight of the two
sober, elderly matrons, my mother and my aunt, in turning
over and surveying the pretty things of her toilet.
My mother, with all her delicate tastes and love of fineness
and exquisiteness, had lived in these respects the
self-denied life of a poor country minister, who never
has but one "best pocket handkerchief," and whom one
pair of gloves must last through a year. It was a fresh
little scene of delight to see the two way-worn matrons
in the calm, silvery twilight of their old age, sitting like
a pair of amicable doves on the trunks in our room,
while my wife displayed to them all her little store of
fineries, and all three chatted them over with as whole-hearted
a zeal as if finery were one of the final ends in
creation.</p>

<p>Every morning it was a part of the family breakfast to
admire some new device of berries or blossoms adapted
to her toilet. Now, it was knots of blue violets, and now
clusters of apple blossoms, that seemed to adapt themselves
to the purpose, as if they had been made for it.
In the same manner she went about the house filling all
possible flower vases with quaint and original combinations
of leaves and blossoms till the house bloomed like a
garland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there were days when I have the vision of my wife
in calico dress and crisp white apron, taking lessons in
ornamental housewifery of my mother and aunt in the
great, clean kitchen. There the three proceeded with all
care and solemnity to perform the incantations out of
which arose strange savory compounds of cakes and confections,
whose recipes were family heir-looms. Out of
great platters of egg-whites, whipped into foamy masses,
these mystical dainties arose, as of old rose Venus from the
foam of the sea.</p>

<p>I observe that the elderly priestesses in the temple of
domestic experience, have a peculiar pride and pleasure
in the young neophyte that seeks admission to these Eleusinian
mysteries.</p>

<p>Eva began to wear an air of precocious matronly gravity,
as she held long discourses with my mother and aunt on
all the high mysteries of household ways, following them
even to the deepest recesses of the house where they displayed
to her their hidden treasures of fine linen and
napery, and drew forth gifts wherewith to enrich our
future home.</p>

<p>In the olden times the family linen of a bride was of
her own spinning and that of her mother and kinswomen;
so that every thread in it had a sacredness of family life
and association. One can fancy dreams of peace could
come in a bed, every thread of whose linen has been
spun by loving and sainted hands. So, the gift to my wife
from my mother was some of this priceless old linen,
every piece of which had its story. These towels were
spun by a beloved aunt Avis, whose life was a charming
story of faith and patience; and those sheets and pillow-cases
were the work of my mother's mother; they had been
through the history of a family life, and came to us
fragrant with rosemary and legend. We touched them
with reverence, as the relics of ascended saints.</p>

<p>Then there were the family receipt books, which had a
quaint poetry of their own. I must confess, in the face of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
the modern excellent printed manuals of cookery and
housekeeping, a tenderness for these old-fashioned receipt
books of our mothers and grandmothers, yellow with age,
where in their own handwriting are the records of their
attainments and discoveries in the art of making life
healthful and charming. There was a loving carefulness
about these receipts&mdash;an evident breathing of human experience
and family life&mdash;they were entwined with so many
associations of the tastes and habits of individual members
of the family, that the reading of my mother's receipt-book
seemed to bring back all the old pictures of home-life;
and this precious manual she gave to Eva, who forthwith
resolved to set up one of her own on the model of it.</p>

<p>In short, by the time our honeymoon had passed, Eva
regarded herself as a passed mistress in the grand free-masonry
of home life, and assumed toward me those
grave little airs of instruction blent with gracious condescension
for male inferiority which obtain among good
wives. She began to be my little mother no less than
wife.</p>

<p>My mother and aunt were confident of her success and
abilities as queen in her new dominions. It was evident
that though a city girl and a child of wealth and fashion,
she had what Yankee matrons are pleased to denominate
"faculty," which is, being interpreted, a <em>genius for home
life</em>, and she was only impatient now to return to her realm
and set up her kingdom.</p>

<p class="ph3">LETTERS FROM NEW YORK.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="A" title="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">About</span>
this time we got a very characteristic letter
from Jim. Here it is:</p>

<p><i>Dear Hal</i>:&mdash;My head buzzes like a swarm of
bees. What haven't I done since you left? The Van Arsdels
are all packing up and getting ready to move out, and
of course I have been up making myself generally useful
there. I have been daily call-boy and page to the adorable
Alice. Mem:&mdash;<em>That girl is a brick!</em> Didn't use to think
so, but she's sublime! The way she takes things is so
confounded sensible and steady! I respect her&mdash;there's
not a bit of nonsense about <em>her</em> now&mdash;you'd better believe.
They are all going up to the old paternal farm to spend
the summer with his father, and by Fall there'll be an
arrangement to give him an income (Van Arsdel I mean),
so that they'll have something to go on. They'll take a
house somewhere in New York in the Fall and do fairly;
but think what a change to Alice!</p>

<p>Oh, by the by, Hal, the Whang Doodle has made her
appearance in our parts again. Yesterday as I sat scratching
for dear life, our friend 'Dacia sailed in, cock's feathers
and all, large as life. She was after money, as usual,
but this time it's her <em>book</em> she insisted on my subscribing
for. She informed me that it was destined to regenerate
society, and she wanted five dollars for it. The title is:</p>

<p class="center">
THE UNIVERSAL EMPYREAN HARMONIAD,<br />
<span class="smaller">BEING</span> <br />
<cite>An Exposition of the Dual Triplicate<br />
Conglomeration of the Infinite</cite>.<br />
</p>

<p>There, now, is a book for you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>'Dacia was in high spirits, jaunty as ever, and informed
me that the millennium was a-coming straight along, and
favored me with her views of how they intended to manage
things in the good time.</p>

<p>The great mischief at present, she informs me, lies in
<em>possessive pronouns</em>, which they intend to abolish. There
isn't to be any <em>my</em> or <em>thy</em>. Everybody is to have everything
just the minute they happen to want it, and everybody else
is to let 'em. Marriage is an old effete institution, a relic of
barbarous ages. There is to be no <em>my</em> of husband and wife,
and no <em>my</em> of children. The State is to raise all the children
as they do turnips in great institutions, and they
are to belong to everybody. Love, she informed me, in
those delightful days is to be free as air; everybody to
do exactly as they've a mind to; a privilege she remarked
that she took now as her right. "If I see a man that
pleases me," said she, "I shall not ask Priest or Levitt for
leave to have him." This was declared with so martial an
air that I shrank a little, but she relieved me by saying,
"You needn't be frightened. I don't want <em>you</em>. You
wouldn't suit me. All I want of you is your money."
Whereat she came down to business again.</p>

<p>The book she informed me was every word of it dictated
by spirits while she was in the trance state, and was composed
conjointly by Socrates, St. Paul, Ching Ling, and
Jim Crow, representing different races of the earth and
states of progression. From some specimens of the style
which she read to me, I was led to hope that we might
all live as long as possible, if that sort of thing is what
we are coming to after death.</p>

<p>Well, it was all funny and entertaining enough to hear
her go on, but when it came to buying the book and planking
the V, I flunked. Told 'Dacia I couldn't encourage her
in possessive pronouns, that she had no more right to the
book than I had, that truth was a universal birthright, and
so the truths in that book were mine as much as hers, and
as I needed a V more than she did I proposed she should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
buy the book of me. She didn't see it in that light, and we
had high words in consequence, and she poured down on me
like a thousand of brick, and so I coolly walked down
stairs, telling her when she had done scolding to shut the
door.</p>

<p>Isn't she a case? The Domini was up in his den, and
I believe she got at him after I left. How he managed
her I don't know. He won't talk about her. The Domini
is working like a Trojan, and his family are doing
finely. The kittens are all over his room with as many
capers as the fairies, and I hear him laughing all by himself
at the way they go on. We have looked at a dozen
houses advertised in the paper, but not one yet is the bargain
you want; but we trudge on the quest all our exercise-time
daily. It will turn up yet, I'm convinced, the very
thing you want.</p>

<p>Height, Hal, you are a lucky dog. I'm like a lean old nag
out on a common, looking over a fence and seeing you in
clover up to your hat-band. If my kettle only could boil
for two I'd risk about the possessive pronouns. To say the
truth I am tired of I and my, and would like to say we and
our if I dared.</p>

<p>Come home any way and kindle your tent fire, and let a
poor tramp warm himself at it.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Your dog and slave,</p>    <p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jim</span>.</p>

<p>Bolton's letter was as follows:</p>

<p><i>Dear Hal</i>:&mdash;I promised you a family cat, but I am going
to do better by you. There is a pair of my kittens that
would bring laughter to the cheeks of a dying anchorite.
They are just the craziest specimens of pure jollity that
flesh, blood, and fur could be wrought into. Who wants
a comic opera at a dollar a night when a family cat will
supply eight kittens a year? Nobody seems to have found
out what kittens are for. I do believe these two kittens of
mine would cure the most obstinate hypochondria of mortal
man, and, think of it, I am going to give them to you!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
Their names are Whisky and Frisky, and their ways are
past finding out.</p>

<p>The house in which the golden age pastoral is to be
enacted has not yet been found. It is somewhere in fairy
land, and will probably suddenly appear to you as things
used to, to good knights in enchanted forests.</p>

<p>Jim and I went down to the steamer yesterday to see
Miss Van Arsdel and your cousin off for Europe. They
are part of a very pleasant party that are going together
and seem in high spirits. I find her articles (your cousin's)
take well, and there is an immediate call for more. So far,
good! Stay your month out, my boy, and get all you can
out of it before you come back to the "Dem'd horrid grind"
of New York.</p>

<p class="quotsig">Ever yours,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bolton</span>.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;While I have been writing, Whisky and Frisky
have pitched into a pile of the proof-sheets of your <cite>Milky
Way</cite> story, and performed a ballet dance with them so that
they are rather the worse for wear. No fatal harm done
however, and I find it reads capitally. I met Hestermann
yesterday quite enthusiastic over one of your articles in the
<cite>Democracy</cite> that happened to hit his fancy, and plumed myself
to him for having secured you next year for his service.
So you see your star is in the ascendant. The Hestermanns
are liberal fellows, and the place you have is as
sure as the Bank of England. So your pastoral will have a
good bit of earthly ground to begin on.</p>

<p class="right"> B. </p>


<p>The next was from Alice.</p>


<p><i>Dear Sister</i>:&mdash;I am so tired out with packing, and all the
thousand and one things that have to be attended to! You
know mamma is not strong, and now you and Ida are
gone, I am the eldest daughter, and take everything on my
shoulders. Aunt Maria comes here daily, looking like a
hearse, and I really think she depresses mamma as much
by her lugubrious ways as she helps. She positively is a
most provoking person. She assumes with such certainty
that mamma is a fool, and that all that has happened out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
of the way comes by some fault of hers, that when she has
been here a day mamma is sure to have a headache. But
I have discovered faculties and strength I never knew I
possessed. I have taken on myself the whole work of separating
the things we are to keep from those which are to
be sold, and those which we are to take into the country
with us, from those which are to be stored in New York
for our return. I don't know what I should have done if
Jim Fellows hadn't been the real considerate friend he is.
Papa is overwhelmed with settling up business matters,
and one wants to save him every care, and Jim has really
been like a brother&mdash;looking up a place to store the goods,
finding just the nicest kind of a man to cart them, and
actually coming in and packing for me, till I told him I
knew he must be giving us time that he wanted for himself&mdash;and
all this with so much fun and jollification that we
really have had some merry times over it, and quite
shocked Aunt Maria, who insists on maintaining a general
demeanor as if there were a corpse in the house.</p>

<p>One wicked thing about Jim is that he will take her off;
and though I scold him for it, between you and me, Eva,
and in the "buzzom of the family," as old Mrs. Knabbs
used to say, I must admit that it's a little too funny for
anything. He can make himself look and speak exactly
like her, and breaks out in that way every once in a
while; and if we reprove him, says, "What's the matter?
Who are you thinking of? I wasn't thinking of what
you were." He is a dreadful rogue, and one can't do anything
with him; but what we should have done without
him, I'm sure I don't know.</p>

<p>Sophie Elmore called the other day, and told me all
about things between her and Sydney. She is sending to
Paris for all her things, and Tullegig's is all in commotion.
They are to be married early in October and go off
for a tour in Europe. You ought to see the gloom on
Aunt Maria's visage when the thing is talked about. If
it had been anybody but the Elmores I think Aunt Maria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
could have survived it, but they have been her Mordecai in
the gate all this time, and now she sees them triumphant.
She speaks familiarly about our being ruined, and finally
the other day I told her that I found ruin altogether a
more comfortable thing than I expected, whereat she looked
at me as if I were an abandoned sinner, sighed deeply,
and said nothing. Poor soul! I oughtn't to laugh, but she
does provoke me so I am tempted to revenge myself in a
little quiet fun at her expense.</p>

<p>The other day Jim was telling me about a house he
had been looking at. Aunt Maria listened with a severe
gravity and interposed with, "Of course nobody could live
on that street. Eva would be crazy to think of it. There
isn't a good family within squares of that quarter."</p>

<p>I said you didn't care for fashion, and she gave me one of
her looks and said, "I trust I sha'n't see Eva in that street;
none but most ordinary people live there." Only think,
Eva, what if you should live on a street where ordinary
people live? How dreadful!</p>

<p>Well, darling, I can't write more; my hands are dusty
with packing and overhauling, and I am writing now on
the top of a box waiting for the man to cart away the next
load. We are all well, and the girls behave charmingly,
and are just as handy and helpful as they can be, and
mamma says she never knew the comfort of her children
before.</p>

<p>God bless you, dear, and good by,</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>

<p class="ph3">AUNT MARIA'S DICTUM.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_o.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Our</span>
lovely moon of moons had now waned, and
the time drew on when, like Adam and Eve,
we were hand in hand to turn our backs on
Paradise and set our faces toward the battle of life.</p>

<p>"The world was all before us where to choose." In
just this crisis we got the following from Aunt Maria:</p>

<p><i>My Dear Eva</i>:&mdash;Notwithstanding all that has passed, I
cannot help writing to show that interest in your affairs,
which it may be presumed, as your aunt and godmother,
I have some right to feel, and though I know that my
advice always has been disregarded, still I think it my
duty to speak, and shall speak.</p>

<p>Of course, as I have not been consulted or taken into
your confidence at all, this may seem like interference,
but I overheard Mr. Fellows talking with Alice about
looking for houses for you, and I must tell you that I
am astonished that you should think of such a thing.
Housekeeping is very expensive, if you keep house with
the least attention to appearance; and genteel board can
be obtained at a far less figure. Then as to your investing
the little that your grandmother left you in a
house, it is something that shows such childish ignorance
as really is pitiable. I don't suppose either you or
your husband ever priced an article of furniture at David
and Saul's in your lives, and have not the smallest idea
of the cost of all those things which a house makes at
once indispensable. You fancy a house arranged as you
have always seen your father's, and do not know that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
kind of marriage you have chosen places all these luxuries
wholly out of your reach. Then as to the house
itself, the whole of your little property would go but a
small way toward giving you a dwelling any way respectable
for you to live in.</p>

<p>It is true there are cheap little houses in New York, but
where, and on what streets? You would not want to live
among mechanics and dentists, small clerks, and people
of that description. Everything when one is first married
depends on taking a right stand in the beginning. Of
course, since the ruin that has come on your father, and
with which you will see I never reproach you, though
you might have prevented it, it is necessary for all of us
to be doubly careful. Everybody is very kind and considerate,
and people have called and continue to invite
us, and we may maintain our footing as before, if we
give our whole mind to it, as evidently it is our duty to
do, paying proper attention to appearances. I have partially
engaged a place for you, subject of course to your
and your husband's approval, at Mivart's, which is a place
that can be spoken of&mdash;a place where the best sort of people
are. Mrs. Mivart is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i> of mine, and is willing
to take you at a considerable reduction, if you take a
small back room. Thus you will have no cares, and no
obligations of hospitality, and be able to turn your resources
all to keeping up the proper air and appearances,
which with the present shocking prices for everything,
silks, gloves, shoes, etc., and the requirements of the times,
are something quite frightful to contemplate.</p>

<p>The course of conduct I have indicated seems specially
necessary in view of Alice's future. The blight that comes
on all her prospects in this dreadful calamity of your
father's is something that lies with weight on my mind.
A year ago Alice might have commanded the very best
of offers, and we had every reason to hope such an establishment
for her as her beauty and accomplishments ought
to bring. It is a mercy to think that she will still be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
invited and have her chances, though she will have to struggle
with her limited means to keep up a proper style;
but with energy and attention it can be done. I have
known girls capable of making, in secret, dresses and
bonnets that were ascribed to the first artists. The puffed
tulle in which Sallie Morton came to your last German was
wholly of her own make&mdash;although of course this was told
me in confidence by her mother and ought to go no farther.
But if you take a mean little house among ordinary low
classes, and live in a poor, cheap, and scrubby way, of course
you cut yourself off from society, and you see it degrades
the whole family. I am sure, as I told your mother, nothing
but your inexperience would lead you to think of it,
and your husband being a literary man naturally would
not understand considerations of this nature. I have seen
a good deal of life, and I give it as the result of my observation
that there are two things that very materially influence
standing in society; the part of the city we live in,
and the church we go to. Of course, I presume you will
not think of leaving your church, which has in it the most
select circles of New York. A wife's religious consolations
are things no husband should interfere with, and I trust you
will not fling away your money on a mean little house in a
fit of childish ignorance. You will want the income of that
money for your dress, and carriages for calls and other
items essential to keep up life.</p>

<p>I suppose you have heard that the Elmores are making
extensive preparations for Sophie's wedding in the Fall.
When I see the vanity and instability of earthly riches, I
cannot but be glad that there is a better world; the consolations
of religion at times are all one has to turn to. Be
careful of your health, my dear child, and don't wet your
feet. From your letters I should infer that you were needlessly
going into very damp unpleasant places. Write me
immediately what I am to tell them at Mivart's.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Your affectionate aunt,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Maria Wouvermans</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>It was as good as a play to see my wife's face as she read
this letter, with flushed cheeks and an impatient tapping
of her little foot that foreboded an outburst.</p>

<p>"Just like her for all the world," she said, tossing the
letter to me, which I read with vast amusement.</p>

<p>"We'll have a house <em>of our own</em> as quick as we can get
one," she said. "I think I see myself gossipping in a boarding
house, hanging on to the outskirts of fashion in the way
she plans, making puffed tulle dresses in secret places and
wearing out life to look as if I were as rich as I am not, and
trying to keep step with people of five times our income.
If you catch Eva Van Arsdel at that game, then tell me!"</p>

<p>"Eva Van Arsdel is a being of the past, fortunately for
me, darling."</p>

<p>"Well, Eva Van Arsdel Henderson, then," said she.
"That compound personage is stronger and more defiant
of worldly nonsense than the old Eva dared to be."</p>

<p>"And I think your aunt has no idea of what there is
developing in Alice."</p>

<p>"To be sure she hasn't; not the remotest. Alice is proud
and sensible, proud in the proper way I mean. She was
full willing to take the goods the gods provided while she
had them, but she never will stoop to all the worries, and
cares, and little mean artifices of genteel poverty. She
never will dress and go out on hunting expeditions to
catch a rich husband. I always said Alice's mind lay in
two strata, the upper one worldly and ambitious, the
second generous and high minded. Our fall from wealth
has been like a land slide, the upper stratum has slid off
and left the lower. Alice will now show that she is both a
strong and noble woman. Our engagement and marriage
has wholly converted her, and she has stood by me like a
little Trojan all along."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "about this letter?"</p>

<p>"Oh! you answer it for me. It's time Aunt Maria learned
that there is a man to the fore; besides <em>you</em> are not vexed,
you are only amused, and you can write a diplomatic
letter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>"And tell her sweetly and politely, with all ruffles and
trimmings, that it is none of her business?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes, just that, but of course with all possible homage
of your high consideration. Then tell we can find a house.
I suppose we can find nice country board for the hot
months near New York, where you can come out every
night on the railroad and stay Sundays."</p>

<p>"Exactly. I have the place all thought of and terms
arranged long ago. A charming Quaker family where you
will find the best of fruit, and the nicest of board, and the
quietest and gentlest of hosts, all for a sum quite within
our means."</p>

<p>"And then," said she, "by Fall I trust we shall find
a house to suit us."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said I. "I have faith that such a house is
all waiting for us somewhere in the unknown future. We
are traveling toward it, and shall know it when we see it."</p>

<p>"Just think," said my wife, "of Aunt Maria as suggesting
that we should board so that we could shirk all obligations
of hospitality! What's life good for if you can't have
your friends with you, and make people happy under your
roof?"</p>

<p>"And who would think of counting the money spent
in hospitality?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yet I have heard of people who purposely plan to have
no spare room in their house," answered Eva. "I remember,
now, Aunt Maria's speaking of Mrs. Jacobs with approbation
for just this piece of economy."</p>

<p>"By which she secures money for party dresses and a
brilliant annual entertainment I suppose," said I.</p>

<p>"Well," said Eva, "I have always imagined my home
with friends in it. A warm peculiar corner for each one
of yours and mine. It is the very charm of the prospect
when I figure this, that, and the other one enjoying with us,
and then I have the great essential of "help" secured. Do
you know that there was one Mary McClellan married from
our house years ago who was a perfect adorer at my shrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
and always begged me to be married that she might come
and live with me? Now she is a widow with a little girl
eight years old, and it is the desire of her heart to get
a place where she can have her child with her. It will fit
exactly. The little cub, under my training, can wait on the
table and tend the door, and Mary will be meanwhile a
mother to me in my inexperience."</p>

<p>"Capital!" said I. "I am sure our star is in the ascendant,
and we shall hear from our house before the summer is
through."</p>

<p>One day, near the first of October, while up for a Sunday
at our country boarding-place, I got the following letter
from Jim Fellows:</p>

<p><i>My Dear Old Boy</i>:&mdash;I think we have got it, I mean got
the house. I am not quite sure what your wife will say,
but I happened to meet Miss Alice last night and I told her,
and she says she is sure it will do. Hear and understand.</p>

<p>Coming down town yesterday I bought the <cite>Herald</cite> and
read to my joy that Jack Fergus had been appointed Consul
to Algiers. To say the truth we fellows have thought
the game was pretty much up with poor Jack; his throat
and lungs are so bad, and his family consumptive. So I said
when I read it, 'Good! there's a thing that'll do.' I went
right round to congratulate him and found three or four of
our fellows doing the same thing. Jack was pleased, said
it was all right, but still I could see there was a hitch
somewhere, and that in fact it was not all right, and when
the other fellows went away I staid, and then it came out.
He said at once that he was glad of the appointment, but
that he had no money; the place at Algiers does not support
a man. He will have to give up his bank salary, and
unless he could sell his house for ready money he could do
nothing. I never knew he had any house. Heaven knows
none of the rest of us have got any houses. But it seems
some aunt of his, an old Knickerbocker, left him one.
Well, I asked him why he didn't sell it. He said he couldn't.
He had had two agents there that morning. They wouldn't
give him any encouragement till the whole place was sold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>together. They wouldn't offer anything, and would only
say they would advertise it on his account. You see it is
one of those betwixt and between places which is going to
be a business place, but isn't yet. So he said; and it was
that which made me think of you and your wife.</p>

<p>I asked where it was, and he told me. It is one of those little
streets that lead out of Varick street, if you know where
that is, I'll bet Mrs. Henderson a dozen pair that she doesn't.
Well, I went with him to see it when the bank closed, for I
still thought of you. By George, I think you will like it. It
is the last house in a block, the street is dull enough but is
inhabited by decent quiet people, who mind their own business.
Of course the respectable Mrs. Wouverman's would
think it an unknown horror to live there; and be quite sure
they were all Jews or sorcerers, or some other sort of come-outers.
Well, this house itself is not like the rest of the
block&mdash;having been built by this old Aunt Martila, or Van
Beest, or whatever else her name was, for her own use. It
is a brick house, with a queer stoop, two and a half stories
high (the house, not the stoop), with a bay-window on the
end, going out on a sort of a church-yard, across which you
look to what is, I believe, St. John's Park<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;a place with
trees, and English sparrows, and bird-houses and things.
Jack and his wife have made the place look quite cosy, and
managed to get a deal of comfort out of it. I wish I could
buy it and take my wife there if only I had one. This place
Jack will sell for eight thousand dollars&mdash;four thousand
down and four thousand on mortgage. I call that dirt
cheap, and Livingstone, our head book-keeper, who used to
be a house-broker, tells me it is a bargain such as he never
heard of, and that you can sell it at any time for more
than that. I have taken the refusal for three days, so come
down, both of you, bright and early Monday and look at it.</p>

<p>So down we came; we saw; we bought. In a few
days we were ready, key in hand, to open and walk into
"Our House."</p>

<p class="ph3">OUR HOUSE.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span>
are certain characteristic words which the
human heart loves to conjure with, and one of the
strongest among them is the phrase, "Our
house." It is not my house, nor your house, nor their
house, but <em>Our House</em>. It is the inseparable <em>we</em> who own it,
and it is the <em>we</em> and the <em>our</em> that go a long way towards impregnating
it with the charm that makes it the symbol of
things most blessed and eternal.</p>

<p>Houses have their physiognomy, as much as persons.
There are common-place houses, suggestive houses, attractive
houses, mysterious houses, and fascinating houses, just
as there are all these classes of persons. There are houses
whose windows seem to yawn idly&mdash;to stare vacantly&mdash;there
are houses whose windows glower weirdly, and look at you
askance; there are houses, again, whose very doors and
windows seem wide open with frank cordiality, which seem
to stretch their arms to embrace you, and woo you kindly to
come and possess them.</p>

<p>My wife and I, as we put our key into the door and let
ourselves into the deserted dwelling, now all our own, said to
each other at once that it was a home-like house. It was built
in the old style, when they had solid timbers and low ceilings
with great beams and large windows, with old-fashioned
small panes of glass, but there was about it a sort of homely
individuality, and suggestive of cosy comforts. The front
room had an ancient fire-place, with quaint Dutch tiles
around it. The Ferguses had introduced a furnace, gas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
and water, into it; but the fire-place in most of the rooms
still remained, suggestive of the old days in New York
when wood was plenty and cheap. One could almost fancy
that those days of roaring family hearths had so heartened
up the old chimneys that a portion of the ancient warmth
yet inhered in the house.</p>

<p>"There, Harry," said my wife, exultantly pointing to the
fire-place, "see, this is the very thing that your mother's
brass andirons will fit into&mdash;how charmingly they will go
with it!"</p>

<p>And then those bright, sunny windows, and that bay-window
looking across upon those trees was perfectly lovely.
In fact, the leaves of the trees shimmering in October light,
cast reflections into the room suggestive of country life,
which, fresh from the country as we were, was an added
charm.</p>

<p>The rooms were very low studded, scarcely nine feet in
height&mdash;and, by the by, I believe that that feature in old
English and Dutch house-building is one that greatly conduces
to give an air of comfort. A low ceiling insures ease
in warming, and in our climate where one has to depend on
fires for nine months in the year, this is something worth
while. In general, I have noticed in rooms that the sense
of snugness and comfort dies out as the ceiling rises in
height&mdash;rooms twelve and fifteen feet high may be all very
grand and very fine, but they are never sociable, they never
seem to brood over you, soothe you, and take you to their
heart as the motherly low-browed room does.</p>

<p>My wife ran all over her new dominions-exploring and
planning, telling me volubly how she would arrange them.
The woman was Queen here; her foot was on her native
heath, and she saw capabilities and possibilities with the
eye of an artist.</p>

<p>Now, I desire it to be understood that I am not indifferent
to the charms of going to housekeeping full-handed. I do
not pretend to say that my wife and I should not have enjoyed
opening our family reign in a stone palace, overlooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
New York Central Park, with all the charms of city and
country life united, with all the upholsterers and furniture
shops in New York at our feet. All this was none too good
for our taste if we could have had it, but since we could not
have it, we took another kind of delight, and one quite as
vivid, in seeing how charmingly we could get on without it.
In fact, I think there is an exultation in the constant victory
over circumstances, in little inventions, substitutions,
and combinations, rendered necessary by limited means
which is wanting to those to whose hand everything comes
without an effort.</p>

<p>If, for example, the brisk pair of robins, who have built in
the elm tree opposite to our bay-window, had had a nest all
made, and lined, and provided for them to go into, what an
amount of tweedle and chipper, what a quantity of fluttering,
and soaring, and singing would have been wanting to
the commencement of their housekeeping! All those pretty
little conversations with the sticks and straw, all that brave
work in tugging at a bit of twine and thread, which finally
are carried off in triumph and wrought into the nest, would
be a loss in nature. How much adventure and enterprise,
how many little heart-beats of joy go into one robin's nest
simply because Mother Nature makes them work it out for
themselves!</p>

<p>We spent a cheerful morning merely in running over our
house, and telling each other what we could do with it, and
congratulating each other that it was "such a bargain," for,
look, here is an outlook upon trees; and here is a little
back yard, considerably larger than a good sized pocket-handkerchief,
where Mrs. Fergus had raised mignonette,
heliotropes, and roses and geraniums enough to have a fresh
morning bouquet of them daily; and an ancient grape-vine
planted by some old Knickerbocker, which Jack Fergus
had trained in a sort of arbor over the dining-room window,
and which at this present moment was hanging with purple
clusters of grapes. We ate of them, and felt like Adam
and Eve in Paradise. What was it to us that this little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
Eden of ours was in an unfashionable quarter, and that, as
Aunt Maria would say, there was not a creature living
within miles of us, it was still our mystical "garden which
the Lord God had planted eastward in Eden." The purchase
of it, it is true, had absorbed all my wife's little fortune,
and laid a debt upon us&mdash;but we told each other that
it was, after all, our cheapest way of renting a foothold in
New York. "For, you see," said my wife instructively,
"papa says it is a <em>safe</em> investment, as it is sure to rise in
value, so that even if we want to sell it we can get more
than we paid."</p>

<p>"What a shrewd little trader you are getting to be!" I
said, admiring this profound financial view.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed I am; and, now, Harry dear, don't let's go to
any expense about furniture till I've shown you what I intend
to do. I know devices for giving a room an air with so
little; for example, look at this recess. I shall fill this up
with a divan that I shall get up for nine or ten dollars."</p>

<p>"You get it up!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I&mdash;with Mary to help me&mdash;you'll see in time. We'll
have all the comfort that could be got out of a sofa, for
which people pay eighty or ninety dollars, and the eighty or
ninety dollars will go to get other things, you see. And
then we must have a stuffed seat running round this bay-window.
I can get that up. I've seen at Stewart's such a
lovely piece of patch, with broad crimson stripes, and a
sort of mauresque figure interposed. I think we had better
get the whole of it, and that will do for one whole room.
Let's see. I shall make lambrequins for the windows, and
cover the window-seats, and then we shall have only to buy
two or three great stuffed chairs and cover them with the
same. Oh, you'll see what I'll do. I shall make this house
so comfortable and charming that people will wonder to see
it."</p>

<p>"Well, darling, I give all that up to you, that is your dominion,
your reign."</p>

<p>"To be sure, you have all your work up at the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
there, and your articles to write, and besides, dear, with all
your genius, and all that, you really don't know much about
this sort of thing, so give yourself no trouble, I'll attend to
it&mdash;it is my ground, you know. Now, I don't mean mother
or Aunt Maria shall come down here till we have got every
thing arranged. Alice is going to come and stay with me
and help, and when I want you I'll call on you, for, though
I am not a writing genius, I am a genius in these matters
as you'll see."</p>

<p>"You are a veritable household fairy," said I, "and this
house, henceforth, lies on the borders of the fairy land.
Troops of gay and joyous spirits are flocking to take possession
of it, and their little hands will carry forward what
you begin."</p>

<p class="ph3">PICNICKING IN NEW YORK.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_o.jpg" width="60" height="59" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Our</span>
house seemed so far to be ours that it was apparently
regarded by the firm of good fellows
as much their affair as mine. The visits of
Jim and Bolton to our quarters were daily, and sometimes
even hourly. They counseled, advised, theorised,
and admired my wife's generalship in an artless solidarity
with myself. Jim was omnipresent. Now he would be
seen in his shirt-sleeves nailing down a carpet, or unpacking
a barrel, and again making good the time lost in these
operations by scribbling his articles on the top of some
packing-box, dodging in and out at all hours with news of
discoveries of possible bargains that he had hit upon
in his rambles.</p>

<p>For a while we merely bivouacked in the house, as of old
the pilgrims in a caravansary, or as a picnic party might
do, out under a tree. The house itself was in a state of
growth and construction, and, meanwhile, the work of eating
and drinking was performed in moments snatched in
the most pastoral freedom and simplicity. I must confess
that there was a joyous, rollicking freedom about these
times that was lost in the precision of regular housekeepers.
When we all gathered about Mary's cooking-stove in
the kitchen, eating roast oysters and bread and butter, without
troubling ourselves about table equipage, we seemed to
come closer to each other than we could in months of orderly
housekeeping.</p>

<p>Our cooking-stove was Bolton's especial protégé and pet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
He had studied the subject of stoves, for our sakes, with
praiseworthy perseverance, and after philosophic investigation
had persuaded us to buy this one, and of course had a
fatherly interest in its well-doing. I have the image of him
now as he sat, seriously, with the book of directions in his
hand, reading and explaining to us all, while a set of muffins
were going through the "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</i>"&mdash;the
oven. The muffins were excellent and we ate them hot out
of the oven with gladness and singleness of heart, and
agreed that we had touched the absolute in the matter of
cooking-stoves. All my wife's plans and achievements, all
her bargains and successes, were reported and admired in
full conclave, when we all looked in at night, and took our
snack together in the kitchen.</p>

<p>One of my wife's enterprises was the regeneration of the
dining-room. It had a pretty window draped pleasantly by
the grape-vine, but it had a dreadfully common wall-paper,
a paper that evidently had been chosen for no other reason
than because it was cheap. It had moreover a wainscot of
dark wood running round the side, so that what with our
low ceiling, the portion covered by this offending paper
was only four feet and a half wide.</p>

<p>I confess, in the multitude of things on hand in the work
of reconstruction, I was rather disposed to put up with the
old paper as the best under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"My dear," said I, "why not let pretty well alone."</p>

<p>"My darling child!" said my wife, "it is impossible&mdash;that
paper is a horror."</p>

<p>"It certainly isn't pretty, but who cares?" said I. "I
don't see so very much the matter with it, and you are undertaking
so much that you'll be worn out."</p>

<p>"It will wear me out to have that paper, so now, Harry
dear, be a good boy, and do just what I tell you. Go to
Berthold &amp; Capstick's and bring me one roll of plain black
paper, and six or eight of plain crimson, and wait then to
see what I'll do."</p>

<p>The result on a certain day after was that I found my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
dining-room transformed into a Pompeiian saloon, by the
busy fingers of the house fairies.</p>

<p>The ground-work was crimson, but there was a series of
black panels, in each of which was one of those floating
Pompeiian figures, which the Italian traveler buys for a
trifle in Naples.</p>

<p>"There now," said my wife, "do you remember my portfolio
of cheap Neapolitan prints? Haven't I made good use
of them?"</p>

<p>"You are a witch," said I. "You certainly can't paper
walls."</p>

<p>"Can't I! haven't I as many fingers as your mother? and
she has done it time and again; and this is such a crumb of
a wall. Alice and Jim and I did it to-day, and have had
real fun over it."</p>

<p>"Jim?" said I, looking amused.</p>

<p>"Jim!" said my wife, nodding with a significant laugh.</p>

<p>"Seems to me," said I.</p>

<p>"So it seems to me," said she. After a pause she added,
with a smile, "but the creature is both entertaining and
useful. We have had the greatest kind of a frolic over this
wall."</p>

<p>"But, really," said I, "this case of Jim and Alice is getting
serious."</p>

<p>"Don't say a word," said my wife, laughing. "They are
in the F's; they have got out of Flirtation and into Friendship."</p>

<p>"And friendship between a girl like Alice and a young
man, on his part soon gets to mean&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, let it get to mean what it will," said my wife;
"they are having nice times now, and the best of it is, nobody
sees anything but you and I. Nobody bothers Alice, or asks
her if she is engaged, and she is careful to inform me that
she regards Jim quite as a brother. You see that is one advantage
of our living where nobody knows us&mdash;we can all
do just as we like. This little house is Robinson Crusoe's
island&mdash;in the middle of New York. But now, Harry, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
is one thing you must do toward this room. There must
be a little gilt molding to finish off the top and sides. You
just go to Berthold &amp; Capstick's and get it. See, here are
the figures," she said, showing her memorandum-book.
"We shall want just that much."</p>

<p>"But, can we put it up?"</p>

<p>"No, but you just speak to little Tim Brady, who is a
clerk there&mdash;Tim used to be a boy in father's office&mdash;he will
like nothing better than to come and put it up for us, and
then we shall be fine as a new fiddle."</p>

<p>And so, while I was driving under a great pressure of
business at the office daily, my home was growing leaf by
leaf, and unfolding flower by flower, under the creative
hands of my home-queen and sovereign lady.</p>

<p>Time would fail me to relate the enterprises conceived,
carried out, and prosperously finished under her hands. Indeed
I came to have such a reverential belief in her power
that had she announced that she intended to take my house
up bodily and set it down in Japan, in the true "Arabian
Nights" style, I should not in the least have doubted her
ability to do it. The house was as much an expression of
my wife's personality, a thing wrought out of her being, as
any picture painted by an artist.</p>

<p>Many homes have no personality. They are made by the
upholsterers; the things in them express the tastes of David
and Saul, or Berthold &amp; Capstick, or whoever else of artificers
undertake the getting up of houses. But our house
formed itself around my wife like the pearly shell around
the nautilus. My home was Eva,&mdash;she the scheming, the
busy, the creative, was the life, soul, and spirit of all that
was there.</p>

<p>Is not this a species of high art, by which a house, in itself
cold and barren, becomes in every part warm and inviting,
glowing with suggestion, alive with human tastes and personalities?
Wall-paper, paint, furniture, pictures, in the
hands of the home artist, are like the tubes of paint out of
which arises, as by inspiration, a picture. It is the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
who combines them into the wonderful creation which we
call a home.</p>

<p>When I came home from my office night after night, and
was led in triumph by Eva to view the result of her achievements,
I confess I began to remember with approbation
the old Greek mythology, and no longer to wonder that
divine honors had been paid to household goddesses.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that she had a portion of the talent of
creating out of nothing. Our house had literally nothing in
it of the stereotyped sets of articles expected as a matter of
course in good families, and yet it looked cosy, comfortable,
inviting, and with everywhere a suggestion of ideal tastes,
and an eye to beauty. There were chambers which seemed
to be built out of drapery and muslins, every detail of
which, when explained, was a marvel of results at small
expense. My wife had an aptitude for bargains, and when
a certain article was wanted, supplied it from some second-hand
store with such an admirable adaptation to the place
that it was difficult to persuade ourselves after a few days
that it had not always been exactly there, where now it was
so perfectly adapted to be.</p>

<p>In fact, her excursions into the great sea of New York
and the spoils she brought thence to enrich our bower reminded
me of the process by which Robinson Crusoe furnished
his island home by repeated visits to the old ship
which was going to wreck on the shore. From the wreck
of other homes came floating to ours household belongings,
which we landed reverently and baptized into the fellowship
of our own.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="upper-case">"Do</span>
you know, Harry," said my wife to me, one
evening when I came home to dinner, "I have
made a discovery?"</p>

<p>Now, the truth was, that my wife was one of those lively,
busy, active, enterprising little women, who are always
making incident for themselves and their friends; and it
was a regular part of my anticipation, as I plodded home
from my office, tired and work-worn, to conjecture what
new thing Eva would find to tell me that night. What had
she done, or altered, or made up, or arranged, as she always
met me full of her subject?</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "what is this great discovery?"</p>

<p>"My dear, I'll tell you. One of those dumb houses in
our neighborhood has suddenly become alive to me. I've
made an acquaintance."</p>

<p>Now, I knew that my wife was just that social, conversing,
conversable creature that, had she been in Robinson
Crusoe's island, would have struck up confidential relations
with the monkeys and paroquets, rather than not
have somebody to talk to. Therefore, I was not in the
least surprised, but quite amused, to find that she had
begun neighboring in our vicinity.</p>

<p>"You don't tell me," said I, "that you have begun to cultivate
acquaintances on this street, so far from the centers
of fashion?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have, and found quite a treasure, in at the
very next door."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>"And pray now, for curiosity's sake, how did you
manage it?"</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth, Harry, I'm the worst person in
the world for keeping up what's called select society; and
I never could bear the feeling of not knowing anything
about anybody that lives next to me. Why, suppose we
should be sick in the night, or anything happen, and we
not have a creature to speak to! It seems dreary to think
of it. So I was curious to know who lived next door; and
I looked down from our chamber-window into the next
back-yard, and saw that whoever it was had a right cunning
little garden, with nasturtiums and geraniums, and
chrysanthemums, and all sorts of pretty things. Well, this
morning I saw the sweetest little dove of a Quaker woman,
in a gray dress, with a pressed crape cap, moving about as
quiet as a chip sparrow among the flowers. And I took
quite a fancy to her, and began to think how I should
make her acquaintance."</p>

<p>"If that isn't just like you!" said I. "Well, did you run
in and fall on her neck?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But, you see, we had all our windows
open to air the rooms, and my very best pocket handkerchief
lay on the bureau. And the wind took it up, and
whirled it about, and finally carried it down into that back-yard;
and it lit on her geranium bush. 'There, now,' said
I to Alice, 'there's a providential opening. I'm just going
to run right down and inquire about my pocket handkerchief.'
Which I did: I just stepped off from our stoop on
to her door-step, and rang the bell. Meanwhile, I saw, on
a nice, shining door plate, that the name was Baxter.
Well, who should open the door but the brown dove in
person, looking just as pretty as a pink in her cap and drab
gown. I declare, Harry, I told Alice I'd a great mind to
adopt the Quaker costume right away. It's a great deal
more becoming than all our finery."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said I, "that introduces a large subject;
and I want to hear what came next."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, well, I spoke up, and said, 'Dear Mrs. Baxter, pray
excuse me; but I've been so very careless as to lose my
handkerchief down in your back-yard.' You ought to
have seen the pretty pink color rise in her cheeks; and she
said in such a cunning way, 'I'll get it for thee!'</p>

<p>"'Oh, dear, no,' said I, 'don't trouble yourself. Please
let me go out into your pretty little garden there.'</p>

<p>"Well, the upshot was, we went into the garden and had
a long chat about the flowers. And she picked me quite a
bouquet of geraniums. And then I told her all about our
little garden, and how I wanted to make things grow in it,
and didn't know how; and asked her if she wouldn't teach
me. Well, then, she took me into the nicest little drab
nest of a parlor that ever you saw. The carpet was drab,
and the curtains were drab, and the sofas and chairs were
all covered with drab; but the windows were perfectly
blazing with flowers. She had most gorgeous nasturtium
vines trained all around the windows, and scarlet geraniums
that would really make your eyes wink to look at
them. I couldn't help laughing a little to myself, that they
make it a part of their religion not to have any color, and
then fall back upon all these high-colored operations of
the Lord by way of brightening up their houses. However,
I got a great deal of instruction out of her, and she's going
to come in and show me how to arrange my ferns and other
things I gathered in the country, in a Ward's case; and
she's going to show me, too, how to plant an ivy, so as to
have it grow all around this bay-window. The inside of
hers is a perfect bower."</p>

<p>"I perceive," said I, "the result of all was that you swore
eternal friendship on the spot, just like the Eva that
you are."</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"And you didn't have the fear of your gentility before
your eyes?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. I always have detested gentility."</p>

<p>"You don't even know the business of her husband."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I do, though. He's a watchmaker, and works for
Tiffany &amp; Co. I know, because she showed me a curious
little clock of his construction; and these things came out
in a parenthesis, you see."</p>

<p>"I see the hopeless degradation which this will imply in
Aunt Maria's eyes," said I.</p>

<p>"A fig for Aunt Maria, and a fig for the world! I'm
married now, and can do as I've a mind to. Besides, you
know Quakers are not world's people. They have come
out from it, and don't belong to it. There's something
really refreshing about this dear little body, with her
'thee's' and her 'thou's' and her nice little ways. And
they're young married people, just like us. She's been in
this house only a year. But, Harry, she knows everybody
on the street,&mdash;not in a worldly way, but in the way of her
sect. She's made a visitation of Christian love to every
one of them. Now, isn't that pretty? She's been to see
what she could do for them, and to offer friendship and
kind offices. Isn't that sort of Arcadian, now?"</p>

<p>"Well, and what does she tell you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are a great many interesting people on this
street. I can't tell you all about it now, but some that
I think we must try to get acquainted with. In the third
story of that house opposite to us is a poor French gentleman,
who came to New York a political refugee, hoping to
give lessons; but has no faculty for getting along, and his
wife, a delicate little woman with a baby, and they're
very, very poor. I'm going with her to visit them some
time this week. It seems this dear little Ruth was with
her when her baby was born,&mdash;this dear little Ruth! It
struck me so curiously to see how interesting she thinks
everybody on this street is."</p>

<p>"Simply," said I, "because she looks at them from the
Christian stand-point. Well, dear, I can't but think your
new acquaintance is an acquisition."</p>

<p>"And only think, Harry, this nice little person is one of
the people that Aunt Maria calls nobody; not rich, not
fashionable, not of the world, in short; but just as sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
and lovely and refined as she can be. I think those plain,
sincere manners are so charming. It makes you feel so
very near to people to have them call you by your Christian
name right away. She calls me Eva and I call her Ruth;
and I feel somehow as if I must always have known her."</p>

<p>"I want to see her," said I.</p>

<p>"You must. It'll amuse you to have her look at you with
her grave, quiet eyes, and call you Harry Henderson. What
an effect it has to hear one's simple, common name, without
fuss or title!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "I remember how long I called you Eva in
my heart, while I was addressing you at arm's length as
Miss Van Arsdel."</p>

<p>"It was in the Park, Harry, that we lost the Mr. and Miss,
never to find them again."</p>

<p>"I've often thought it strange," said I, "how these unworldly
modes of speaking among the Quakers seem to
have with them a certain dignity. It would be an offense,
a piece of vulgar forwardness, in most people to address
you by your Christian name. But, with them it seems to
be an attempt at realizing a certain ideal of Christian simplicity
and sincerity, which one almost loses sight of in the
conventional course of life."</p>

<p>"I was very much amused," said my wife, "at her telling
me of one of her visits of Christian love to a Jew family,
living on this street. And really, Harry, she has learned
an amount of good about the Jews, from cultivating an
intimacy with this family, that is quite astonishing. I'd
no idea how good the Jews were."</p>

<p>"Well, my little High-Church darling," said I, "you're
in a fair way to become ultra-liberal, and to find that what
you call <em>the</em> Church doesn't come anywhere near representing
the whole multitude of the elect in this world. I comfort
myself with thinking, all the time, how much more good
there is in the world and in human nature than appears on
the surface."</p>

<p>"And, now, Harry, that you and I have this home of our
own, we can do some of those things with it that our friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
next door seem to be doing. I thought we might stir about
and see if we couldn't get up a class for this poor Frenchman,
and I'm going to call on his wife. In fact, Harry, I've
been thinking that it must be one's own fault if one has no
friends in one's neighborhood. I can't believe in living on
a street, and never knowing or caring whether your next-door
neighbor is sick or dead, simply because you belong
to a circle up at the other end of the city."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, you know that I am a democrat by nature.
But I am delighted to have you make these discoveries for
yourself. It was bad enough, in the view of your friends,
presume, for me to have come between you and a fashionable
establishment, and a palace on the Park, without being
guilty of introducing you into such very mixed society as
the course that you're falling into seems to promise. But
wherever you go I'll follow."</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="upper-case">"My</span>
dear," said my wife to me at breakfast, "our
house is about done. To be sure there are
ever so many little niceties that I haven't got
as yet, but it's pretty enough now. So that I'm not at all
ashamed to show it to mamma or Aunt Maria, or any of
them."</p>

<p>"Do you think," said I, "that last-named respectable individual
could possibly think of countenancing us, when
we have only an ingrain carpet on our parlor and nothing
but mattings on the chambers, and live down here where
nobody lives?"</p>

<p>"Well, poor soul!" said Eva, "she'll have to accept it as
one of the trials of life, and have recourse to the consolations
of religion. Then, after all, Harry, I really am proud
of our parlor. Of course, we've had the good luck to have
a good many handsome ornaments given to us; so that,
though we haven't the regulation things that people generally
get, it does look very bright and pretty."</p>

<p>"It's perfectly lovely," said I. "Our house to me is a
perfect dream of loveliness. I think of it all day from
time to time when I'm at work in my office, and am always
wanting to come home and see it again, and have a little
curiosity to know what new thing you've accomplished.
So far, your career has been a daily succession of triumphs,
and the best of it is that it's all so much like you."</p>

<p>"So," said she, "that I can't be jealous at your loving the
house so much. I suppose you think it as much a part of
me as the shell on a turtle's back. Well, now, before
we invite mother and Aunt Maria, and all the folks down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
here, I propose that we have just a nice little housewarming,
with our own little private particular set, who know
how to appreciate us."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" said I; "Bolton, and Jim, and Alice, and you
and I will have a commemoration-dinner together. Our
fellows, you see, seem to feel as much interested in this
house as if it were their own."</p>

<p>"I know it," said she. "Isn't it really amusing to see the
grandfatherly concern that Bolton has for our cooking-stove?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Bolton has staked his character on that stove," I
said. "Its success is quite a personal matter now."</p>

<p>"Well, it does bake admirably," said my wife, "and I
think our dinner will be a perfect success, so far as that is
concerned. And, do you know, I'm going to introduce that
new way of doing up cold chicken which I've invented."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "we shall christen it Chicken <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Eva</i>."</p>

<p>"And I've been talking with our Mary about it, and she's
quite in the spirit of the affair. You see, like all Irish
women, Mary perfectly worships the boys, and thinks there
never was anybody like Mr. Bolton, and Mr. Jim; and of
course it's quite a labor of love with her. Then I've been
giving her little cub there a series of lessons to enable her
to wait on table; and she is all exercised with the prospect."</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "the little flibberty-gibbet is hardly as
high as the table."</p>

<p>"Oh, never say that before her. She feels very high
indeed in the world, and is impressed with the awful
gravity and responsibility of being eight years old. I have
made her a white apron with pockets, in which her soul
delights; and her mother has starched and ironed it till it
shines with whiteness. And she is learning to brush the
table-cloth, and change plates in the most charming way,
and with a gravity that is quite overcoming."</p>

<p>"Capital!" said I. "And when shall it be?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>"Agreed! I'll tell the fellows this is to be a regular blow-out,
and we must do our very prettiest, which is very pretty
indeed," said I, "thanks to the contributions of our numerous
friends. For my part, I think the fashion of wedding-presents
has proved a lucky thing for us."</p>

<p>"Even if we have six pie-knives, and no pie to eat with
them," said my wife, "as may happen in our establishment
pretty often."</p>

<p>"Still," said I, "among them all there are a sufficiency of
articles that give quite another aspect to our prudent little
house from what it would wear if we were obliged to buy
everything ourselves."</p>

<p>"Yes," said my wife, "and one such present as that set of
bronzes on the mantel-piece gives an air to a whole room.
A mantel-piece is like a lady's bonnet. It's the headpiece of
a room, and if that be pleasing the rest is a good deal taken
for granted. Then, you see, our parlor is all of a warm
color,&mdash;crimson carpet, crimson curtains,&mdash;everything warm
and glowing. And so long as you have the color it isn't a
bit of matter whether your carpet cost three dollars and a
half a yard or eighty-seven cents, and whether your curtains
are damask or Turkey red. Color is color, and will
produce its effects, no matter in what material."</p>

<p>"And we men," said I, "never know what the material is,
if only the effect is pleasant. I always look at a room as a
painting. It never occurs to me whether the articles in it
are cheap or dear, so that only the general effect is warm,
and social, and agreeable. And that is just what you have
made these rooms. I think the general effect of the rooms,
either by daylight, or lamp-light, or firelight, would be to
make a person like to stay in them, and when he had left
them want to come back."</p>

<p>"Yes," said my wife, "I flatter myself our rooms have
the air of belonging to people that are having nice times,
and enjoying themselves, as we are. And, for my own
part, I feel like sitting right down in them. All that round
of party-going, and calling, and visiting, that I used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
have to keep up, seems to me really wearisome. I want
you to understand, Harry, that it's not the slightest sacrifice
in the world for me to give it up. I'm just happy to
be out of it."</p>

<p>"You see," said I, "we can sit down here and make our
own world. Those that we really like very much and who
like us very much will come to us. My ideal of good
society is of a few congenial persons who can know each
other very thoroughly, so as to feel perfectly acquainted
and at home with one another. That was the secret of those
reunions that went on so many years around Madame Récamier.
It made no difference whether she lived in a palace,
or a little obscure street; her friends were real friends,
and followed her everywhere. The French have made a
science of the cultivation of friendship, which is worth
study."</p>

<p>Thus my wife and I chatted, and felicitated each other,
in those first happy home making days. There was never
any end to our subjects of mutual conversation. Every
little change in our arrangements was fruitful in conversation.
We hung our pictures here at first, and liked them
well, but our maturer second-thoughts received bright
inspirations to take them down and hang them there; and
then we liked them better. I must say, by the by, that I
had committed one of those extravagances which lovers do
commit when they shut their eyes and go it blind. I had
bought back the pictures of Eva's little boudoir from Goupil's.
The fact was that there was a considerable sympathy
felt for Mr. Van Arsdel, and one of the members of the
concern was a nice fellow, with whom I had some pleasant
personal acquaintance. So that the redemption of the pictures
was placed at a figure which made it possible for me
to accomplish it. And the pictures themselves were an untold
store of blessedness to us. I believe we took them all
down and hung them over four times, on four successive
days, before we were satisfied that we had come to ultimate
perfection.</p>

<p class="ph3">PREPARATIONS FOR OUR DINNER PARTY.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap2" src="images/drop_h-quote.jpg" width="70" height="60" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="upper-case">"Harry,"</span>
said my wife, the morning of the day
of our projected house-warming, "there's one
thing you must get me."</p>

<p>"Well, Princess?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know you and I don't care for wine and
don't need it, and can't afford it, but I have such a pretty
set of glasses and decanters, and you must get me a couple
of bottles just to set off our table for celebration."</p>

<p>Immediately I thought of Bolton's letter, of what he had
told me of the effect of wine upon his senses at Hestermanns
dinner table. I knew it must not be at ours, but
how to explain to my wife without compromising him! At
a glance I saw that all through the future my intimacy
with Bolton must be guided and colored by what I knew
of his history, his peculiar struggles and temptations,
and that not merely now, but on many future occasions I
should need a full understanding with my wife to act as I
should be obliged to act. I reflected that Eva and I had
ceased to be two and had become one, that I owed her an unlimited
confidence in those respects where my actions must
involve her comfort, or wishes, or coöperation.</p>

<p>"Eva, darling," I said, "you remember I told you there
was a mystery about the separation of Bolton and Caroline."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said she, wondering, "but what has
this to do with this wine question?"</p>

<p>"A great deal," I said, and going to my desk I took out
Bolton's letter and put it into her hand. "Read that my
dear and then tell me what to do." She took it and read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
with something of the eagerness of feminine curiosity
while I left the room for a few moments. In a little while
she came after me and laid her hand on my arm.</p>

<p>"Harry, dear," she said "I'll stand by you in this thing.
His secret shall be sacred with me, and I will make a safe
harbor for him where he may have a home without danger.
I want our house to seem like a home for him."</p>

<p>"You are an angel, Eva."</p>

<p>"Well, Harry, I must say I always have had conscience
about offering wine to some young men that I knew ought
to keep clear of it, but it never occurred to me in regard to
such a grave noble man as Bolton."</p>

<p>We never know who may be in this danger. It is a
diseased action of the nervous system&mdash;often inherited&mdash;a
thing very little understood, like the tendency to insanity
or epilepsy. But while we know such things are,
we cannot be too careful.</p>

<p>"I should never have forgiven myself, Harry, if I had
done it."</p>

<p>"The result would have been that Bolton would never
have dined with us again, he is resolute to keep entirely
out of all society where this temptation meets him."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't want it, don't need it, and won't have it.
Mary makes magnificent coffee and that's even so much
better. So that matter is settled, Harry, and I'm ever and
ever so glad you told me. I do admire him so much! There
is something really sad and noble in his struggle."</p>

<p>"Many a man with that temptation who fails often
exercises more self-denial, and self-restraint, than most
Christians," said I.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't deny myself much. I generally want
to do just what I do," said Eva.</p>

<p>"You always want to do all that is good and generous,"
said I.</p>

<p>"I think, on the whole," said Eva, reflectively, "my self-denial
is in not doing what other people want me to. I'm
like Mrs. Quickly. I want to please everybody. I wanted
to please mamma and Aunt Maria."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>"And came very near marrying a man you couldn't love
purely to oblige people."</p>

<p>"If you hadn't rescued me," she said, laughing. "But
now, Harry, really I want some little extravagance about
our dinner. So if we don't have wine, buy the nicest of
grapes and pears, and I will arrange a pretty fruit piece
for the center of the table."</p>

<p>"My love, I will get you all the grapes and pears you
want."</p>

<p>"And my little Ruth has sent me in this lovely tumbler
of apple jelly. You see I held sweet council with her
yesterday on the subject of jelly-making, where I am only
a novice, and hers is splendid; literally now, splendid, for
see how the light shines through it! And do you think the
generous little Puss actually sent me in half a dozen tumblers."</p>

<p>"What a perfect saint!" said I.</p>

<p>"And I am to have all the flowers in her garden. She
says the frost will take them in a day or two if we don't.
Harry, next summer we must take lessons of her about
our little back yard. I never saw so much made of so
little ground."</p>

<p>"She'll be only too delightful," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, now, mind you are home at five. I want you to
look the house over before your friends come, and see if I
have got everything as pretty as it can be."</p>

<p>"Are they to "<em>process</em>" through the house and see your
blue room, and your pink room, and your guest chamber,
and all?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I want them to see all through how pretty the
rooms are, and then sometimes, perhaps, we shall tempt
them to stay all night."</p>

<p>"And sleep in the chamber that is called Peace," said I,
"after the fashion of Pilgrim's Progress."</p>

<p>"Come, Harry, begone. I want you to go, so as to be
sure and come back early."</p>

<p class="ph3">THE HOUSE-WARMING.</p>


<div> <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_d.jpg" width="60" height="61" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Dear</span>
reader, fancy now a low-studded room, with
crimson curtains and carpet, a deep recess filled
a crimson divan with pillows, the lower part of
the room taken up by a row of book-shelves, three feet high,
which ran all round the room and accommodated my library.
The top of this formed a convenient shelf, on which all our
pretty little wedding presents&mdash;statuettes, bronzes, and articles
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vertu</i>&mdash;were arranged. A fire-place, surrounded by
an old-fashioned border of Dutch tiles, with a pair of grandmotherly
brass andirons, nibbed and polished to an extreme
of brightness, exhibits a wood fire, all laid in order to be
lighted at the touch of the match. My wife has dressed the
house with flowers, which our pretty little neighbor has
almost stripped her garden to contribute. There are vases of
fire-colored nasturtiums and many-hued chrysanthemums
the arrangement of which has cost the little artist an afternoon's
study, but which I pronounce to be perfect. I have
come home from my office an hour earlier to see if she has
any commands.</p>

<p>"Here, Harry," she says, with a flushed face, "I believe
everything now is about as perfect as it can be. Now come
and stand at this door, and see how you think it would strike
anybody, when they first came in. You see I've heaped up
those bronze vases on the mantel with nothing but nasturtiums;
and it has such a surprising effect in that dark bronze!
Then I've arranged those white chrysanthemums right
against these crimson curtains. And now come out in the
dining-room, and see how I've set the dinner-table! You
see I've the prettiest possible center-piece of fruit and
flowers. Isn't it lovely?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course I kissed her and said it was lovely, and that
she was lovelier; and she was a regular little enchantress,
witch, and fairy-queen, and ever so much more to the same
purport. And then Alice came down, all equipped for conquest,
as pretty an additional ornament to the house as heart
could desire. And when the clock was on the stroke of six,
and we heard the feet of our guests at the door, we lighted
our altar-fire in the fire-place; for it must be understood
that this was a pure <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de théâtre</i>, a brightening, vivifying,
ornamental luxury&mdash;one of the things we were determined
to have, on the strength of having determined not to
have a great many others. How proud we were when the
blaze streamed up and lighted the whole room, fluttered on
the pictures, glinted here and there on the gold bindings of
the books, made dreamy lights and deep shadows, and
called forth all the bright glowing color of the crimson tints
which seemed to give out their very heart to firelight! My
wife was evidently proud of the effect of all things in our
rooms, which Jim declared looked warm enough to bring a
dead man to life. Bolton was seated in due form in a great,
deep arm-chair, which, we informed him, we had bought
especially with reference to him, and the corner was to be
known henceforth as his corner.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, with grave delight, "I have brought my
final contribution to your establishment;" and forthwith
from the capacious hinder pockets of his coat he drew forth
a pair of kittens, and set them down on the hearth-rug.
"There, Harry," he said, gravely, "there are a pair of ballet
dancers that will perform for you gratis, at any time."</p>

<p>"Oh, the little witches, the perfect loves!" said my wife
and Alice, rushing at them.</p>

<p>Bolton very gravely produced from his pocket two long
strings with corks attached to them, and hanging them to
the gas fixtures, began, as he said, to exhibit the ballet
dancing, in which we all became profoundly interested.
The wonderful leaps and flings and other achievements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
the performers occupied the whole time till dinner was announced.</p>

<p>"Now, Harry," said my wife, "if we let Little Cub see the
kittens, before she's waited on table, it'll utterly demoralize
her. So we must shut them in carefully," which was done.</p>

<p>I don't think a dinner party was ever a more brilliant success
than ours; partly owing to the fact that we were a mutual
admiration society, and our guests felt about as much
sense of appropriation and property in it as we did ourselves.
The house was in a sort of measure "our house," and
the dinner "our dinner." In short, we were all of us strictly
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en famille</i>. The world was one thing, and we were another,
outside of it and by ourselves, and having a remarkably
good time. Everybody got some share of praise. Mary got
praised for her cooking. The cooking-stove was glorified
for baking so well, and Bolton was glorified for recommending
the cooking-stove. And Jim and Alice and my
wife congratulated each other on the lovely looks of the
dining-room. We shuddered together in mutual horror
over what the wall-paper there had been; and we felicitated
the artists that had brought such brilliant results out
of so little. The difficulties that had been overcome in
matching the paper and arranging the panels were forcibly
dwelt upon; and some sly jokes seemed to pass between
Jim and Alice, applicable to certain turns of events in these
past operations. After dinner we had most transcendent
coffee, and returned to our parlor as gay of heart as if we
had been merry with wine. The kittens had got thoroughly
at home by that time, having investigated the whole of the
apartment, and began exhibiting some of their most irresistible
antics, with a social success among us of a most
flattering nature. Alice declared that she should call them
Taglioni and Madame Céleste, and proceeded to tie blue
and pink bows upon their necks, which they scratched and
growled at in quite a warlike manner. A low whine from
the entry interrupted us; and Eva, opening the door and
looking out, saw poor old Stumpy sitting on the mat, with
the most good-dog air of dejected patience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, here's Stumpy, poor fellow!" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't trouble yourself about him," said Bolton.
"I've taught him to sit out on the mat. He's happy enough
if he only thinks I'm inside."</p>

<p>"But, poor fellow," said Eva, "he looks as if he wanted
to come in."</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll do well enough; never mind him," said Bolton,
looking a little embarrassed. "It was silly of me to bring
him, only he is so desolate to have me go out without him."</p>

<p>"Well, he shall come in," said Eva. "Come in, you poor
homely old fellow," she said. "I daresay you're as good as
an angel; and to-night's my house-warming, and not even
a dog shall have an ungratified desire, if I can help it."</p>

<p>So poor Stumpy was installed by Bolton in the corner,
and looked perfectly beatified.</p>

<p>And now, while we have brought all our characters before
the curtain, and the tableau of the fireside is complete, as
we sit there all around the hearth, each perfectly at home
with the other, in heart and mind, and with even the poor
beasts that connect us with the lower world brightening
in our enjoyment, this is a good moment for the curtain
to fall on the fortunes of</p>

<p>This journal has had a very remarkable success, <em>in one year</em> attaining
a circulation surpassing that of any other religious weekly in the United

<p class="bigger center"><em>WHY IS IT?</em></p>

<p><b>BECAUSE</b>, <b>First</b>, HENRY WARD BEECHER is its Editor, and his
Editorials, Star Papers, and occasional Literary Reviews and <cite>Lecture-Room
Talks</cite> are sought for by thousands, while the auxiliary editorial
labor is in the hands of cultivated journalists; <em>the CONTRIBUTORS
being representative men of ALL Denominations</em>.</p>

<p><b>BECAUSE</b>, <b>Secondly</b>, ITS FORM, sixteen pages, large quarto, <span class="smcap">Stitched
and Cut</span>, is so convenient for reading, binding, and preservation, as to
be a great and special merit in its favor.</p>

<p><b>BECAUSE</b>, <b>Thirdly</b>, <em>It is called "the Most Interesting Religious Paper published,"</em>
being quoted from by the press of the entire country more extensively
than any other. The critical <cite>Nation</cite> (N. Y.) says it is "Not only
the ablest and best, but also, as we suppose, the most popular of American
religious periodicals. At all events it is safe to predict that it will
soon have, if it has not already, greater influence than any other religious
paper in the country."</p>

<p><b>BECAUSE</b>, <b>Fourthly</b>, <em>It has something for every Member of the Household</em>,
admirable contributed and editorial articles, discussing all timely topics;
fresh information on unhackneyed subjects; reliable news of the Church
and the world; Market and Financial Reports; an Agricultural Department;
excerpts of Public Opinion from the press; careful Book Reviews,
with Educational, Literary, Musical, and Art Notes; much matter
of a high and pure religious tone; a Household Department; choice
Poems; Household Stories; and Chat for the Little Ones.</p>

at a rate <em>entirely exceptional</em>. So that, although the selling price
of them is (<b>$10</b>) <em>Ten Dollars</em>, at which price thousands have been sold in
America, and still are selling and will be sold by the picture trade generally,
the Publishers of <span class="smcap">The Christian Union</span> <em>give away</em> the <em>two</em> pictures,
